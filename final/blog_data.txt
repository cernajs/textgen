A Violent Collision With The Self
<|story|>
Whilst leafing a second-hand book in Oxfam a newspaper cutting fell with a photograph of his childhood abuser. A grotesque mask of a man forty years on with an article about historical serial crimes. Victims had bravely spoken out and others followed. Years of stoically looking the other way when friendship was offered. Rictus smiles to conceal searing pain and acute shame. A laugh was merely an echo of hollow insides, yearning for sincere emotions; self-protection borne of comanding the chaos and pacifying the inevitable storm successfully with convincing fortitude. The next noise he heard was his own primal scream.

Cursed Year
<|story|>
Late summer leaves, brownish green sway earthward.Their dance entrances me from the kitchen window. A shrink may call it dissociating. I call it a respite. In the distance, my phone is ringing and for just a millisecond, I wonder why she is calling me now. My heart sinks. Let it ring. The person whose call I often ignored and sometimes dreaded isn’t calling. The ringing silenced, I decided to listen to her voicemails instead, taking comfort in 2023, as 2024 is almost too much to bear. Dissociating really gets a bad rep.

Backyard Comfort

Editor's Choice Thomas reached through the fence, stealthily plucked and tasted the red, ripe raspberries, and heard weeping from beyond the vines. Small and vulnerable, sitting on the tear-stained garden bench, Sabine looked not at all like the most sparkling girl in grade eight. Concerned, Thomas entered her backyard through the gate. “What’s wrong, Sabbie?” She looked up. “Everything.” “The divorce?” She nodded. “I felt the same way.” Thomas sat beside her and tentatively put his arm around his classmate’s shoulder. Sabine leaned into his awkward embrace and their lips met, soft and salty-sweet – his stolen raspberries mingling with her dusky teardrops.

The Institute of Irony

It sits behind bullet-proof glass, dark as a cave’s mouth, the dimensions of a Pop-Tart. This, says the guide, is what enabled the Age of Repression. They spread like a brushfire with the promise that the world would be at the owner’s fingertips. This was true, to some extent, but they also bred loneliness, anxiety, and narcissism; people lost the ability to read more than a phrase at a time; they became emotional in their reactions. Logic became a lost art. It ensured that people were tractable, divided and dumb. It’s here because of what they were called. Are you ready? Smartphones.

Smoke Break

Eyes closed, bare feet in the sand, I inhale the salty breeze--—and then am bumped by my cumbersome neighbor, barreling out onto the stoop into my shoulder. My eyes squint open and see the street, buildings, bumper-to-bumper cars, people. There’s no breeze—only the flap of dirty pigeon wings and street squirrels fighting over stale fries in the gutter. Honks and shouts assault my ears. I take a drag of my cigarette, the paper sizzles towards my lips; I exhale a large cloud of my own pollution. I am definitely not at the beach.

Lesser infants would undoubtedly have made an effort to wriggle back into the amniotic safety of the womb, but not Gerald. He stayed the course and soldiered on, though he refused to latch onto or take nourishment from his mother’s breast. However, less than two short decades later, Gerald Rensselaer took to other breasts most assiduously.

An unfamiliar metallic clawing noise echoed up the stairwell from the flooded basement. The clawing grew louder. Sharper. Closer. Something big was climbing the stairs.

The Rain Dance
<|story|>
They told me to take the blue pills after you died, mother, but no-no. Instead, I collected 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 pills, shoved them inside my dresser, my fingers sliding on silk until I found the rainstick.Quietly, I slipped out my window at 4 am to walk the neighborhood, shirtless in a pair of panties, the color of sorrow. The voices told me to shake-shake-shake that stick, dance, dance until the heavens, o-p-e-n-e-d, up. When a slight breeze ruffled my hair, I stretched out my arms as cool rain drops came down-down-down. It all washed over me, mother, you-you, you’re healing tears.

The Perennial Summer Invasion
<|story|>
The water’s deep, the struggle pitiful to watch. I could continue onwards, forget I saw this desperate fight for survival. What’s the loss of one among thousands? They’re scum in many people’s eyes. But the picture of suffering burns like a hot poker into my conscience. It’s nothing, yet everything. My gloved hands enter the water, scooping expertly under flailing legs; a thin stream trickles through my fingers. It’s not too late. No doubt she and her kin will return to bug me in a month or so but my heart sings as the wasp vanishes over the privet hedge.

He plants them in serried rows, nine inches between. Root down, crown up. Grafts canine with cuspid, tusk with molar, waters them with rust-colored fertilizer until the ground blackens. He whispers words of growth, and the earth cracks. Bone-white shoots claw upward, sprout fingers, unfurl translucent fronds, silvered thorns--At night, we watch them grow. We watch and tongue the hollows of our gums each time he stoops and turns the soil with shoveled hands. We await the new moon when he plucks the fruit from their stems, when he thrusts them in his mouth.

Reflections

The image in the mirror was unsettling. It was the same old question. Was she look more like her father or her mother? The overgrown eyebrows, dried up skin, bloodshot eyes, and the unceasing frown. That was her father. There was the sagging arm, nervous blinking, and harrow-like corrugations in her forehead. That was her mother. Where was her own influence? Was she just the random mixing of her parents’ genes?“Grandma, can you read Peter Pan to us? And do all the voices! That’s the fun part!”Maybe she was something more after all.

As the color drained from his face, his wife called their daughter Gracie and bellowed, “Help!”When Gracie opened her father’s app her eyes flew open wide. “Yikes, Dad, she yelped, “this is bad. I’m deleting your account right now.”With the posts removed, Dan sunk into bed relieved, clueless he’d soon be unemployed.

A Life Sentence
<|story|>
From atop the precarious ladder the loft was eerie silent, as was the rest of our house without your murderous rage.The decorations, untouched since before they took you away for 12 years. I’d forgotten the personalised glass baubles. Christmas gnomes in green glitter and a red paper scroll inside for 'a secret Christmas wish’.Shuddering, I lost my balance but reached to steady myself. Still, the two baubles fell, smashing on the landing laminate floor below. Two red notes stretched out, unfurled amid a mosaic of glass. Mine read “love you always”. Yours read “Till death do us part”.

“I hate you”, she screams at me, her body tense with rage, fists clenched, face livid. Each syllable penetrates my heart, hurled from an intricately carved spear. Trained well, I feel my feet connecting with socks with shoes, with the old linoleum floor and on through the metal layers of the building to finally touch the earth. Trained well, I sense pulsations travel through skin, muscles, bones. Witnessing a lifetime’s grief. Breathing in a phosphorescence of suffering. Sharing, as always, my mother’s grief.

Lend Me an Ear

The worse part about time traveling is the arrival materialization. The electrical sensation of my atoms congealing back together is very unsettling. I hoped they got all the parts this time. They somehow forgot my left ear two trips ago, and the eighteen hundreds didn’t have plastic surgeons. I was still able to create 2,100 pieces of art and 860 oil paintings, but that ear thing haunted me through the centuries. I hid it with long hair and wearing hats, but eventually, I just told everyone I got drunk one night and cut it off.

I tear and twist, breaking you apart and taking everything I can. I peel off your muscle tissues, revealing organs. Liver. Lungs. Kidneys. Noises and suspicious eyes behind—I set it aside.

Shyamala described how her son was grazing the cows, how every day when the sun crested the top of the hill - she pointed a scraggly finger at a red mound festooned with green - his deepening voice would ring out a greeting for his mother. But that day the river was high, fast. She could not afford slippers. He must have sung Kanhaiya, as he loved. Tears fell. Christine’s face, too, was wet. “Her son, too,” I translated.

A thought flashed “Was it a right decision for a colored woman to run for the presidency in a still racially-divided nation?”Then she noticed the painting at the distant wall; a reproduction of Norman Rockwell’s “Murder in Mississippi”, based on targeted killing of three young civil-era activists by white supremacists KKK. The haunting imagery captured the harsh realities of past racial violence and injustice. Now, the opposition candidate retorted to same tactics.

Confessions of a College Heretic

His smile was plastic and drawn across his face like a cartoon. His personality oozed superficiality. He was as deep as one thin dime.A natural politician, Professor Lewis thought. No wonder he’s the college president. And with a doctorate in education! That’s not a real discipline, he sneered. Might as well get a degree in phrenology. His own doctorate in philosophy was meat and potatoes compared to the president’s poor diet of rice and beans. And the president earned more than twice what an associate professor earned. Nietzsche was right about one thing, he thought. Everything matters. Nothing's important.

If he can become President, anyone can. Bit like Lincoln. So he appeals to stupid people.”“That makes sense… I suppose. But those grades – straight As?”“Remember his dad’s rich.

At the summit we view treetops – see through for miles. You pull me close, wrap me in a cloud.

His father filming, laughing; sisters snickering.Mid-kick—jolted by their mockery—Dickie rises. Puffs out his chest. Casts an evil eye as he strides off the set. “Now that’s star material!” His father shouts. “Take two!”

It made me remember when we were together, all the good times, the wonderful memories, how happy we once were. Then, as she left, walking right past me, I realized that she looked very little, really nothing at all, like you.

A Wedding

She barged into the church in a plain black dress. Flung herself at the altar, wailing and tearing at her hair with her long brown fingernails. The photographer crossed himself and took rapid shots.

Mission accomplished. When she stood up to leave, the photographer ran up to her and said, “you're a bridesmaid? Please keep it going. That's the most interesting position I've seen.”

No More Teachers' Dirty Looks
<|story|>
"School's out for summer" sang Alice Cooper in the 1970s."School's out forever", the song continued. No, not quite...I remember the end of secondary school, leavers autographing blue shirts and blouses, swapping education for a working life, with some of us staying on for A-levels. Two years later, more swapping to a working life (no shirt signing), and us few going to university before ultimately heading the same way."School's out for summer". They still sing it, in young voices, my wife reports."School's out forever". This time, yes...She's retiring.

When her husband died unexpectedly, she couldn’t be in her home anymore, so she moved into the garden house. Mostly, the wife sat in the metal chair gazing out toward the baby-blue sky. She waited for the summer sun to greet her in the morning and waited for the sunset to kiss her goodnight. The wife lived off the land, picking blackberries, cucumbers, and tomatoes from the grounds for nourishment until her husband came to her in a dream mouthing the words, I’m with you at daybreak. I am that red cardinal in the tree telling you to rise-rise-rise.

The Dancer

While returning from the market, I saw her dancing outside a shop to the tune of a film song. The song was being played as part of Holi celebrations. What infuriated me was the way the passers-by were throwing coins at her feet. They seemed to be thinking that the little girl was trying to earn bread by dancing in a public place. I stopped her instantly and dragged her home where her parents thrashed her for bringing dishonour to the family. Years later, her parents were seen kissing her proudly for her dancing on stage as an international celebrity.

The Dead Letters Subway Blues

The guilty politician aches with sad indecision, while the pregnant 14-year-old claims it’s just another miracle birth, and so many ragged street people see the light, but it’s just the moon full and laughing. Climate change hides behind the Capitol dome as Moby Dick does stupid tricks at Sea World hoping for absolution if not freedom. Jack the Ripper, deaf and penniless, walks with his dark cloud, looking for a well-worn rabbit hole and a free lunch. And me? I just sit in an abandoned national park with all the tarnished shards of old Democracy and hum show tunes.

That's How I Felt

Sometimes at night I think about when I was a girl. Balmy summer evenings were really not always warm but the light meant we could play for hours.I remember that girl called Caroline. She was wild and mesmerising with legs like a rifle pull-through. She came from the city and she caught frogs, liked caressing their cool skin. Once she put a cold frightened frog down the back of my dress. I screamed even though I was trying to pretend it was nothing, trying to be brave.That’s how I felt when they told me about the diagnosis.

When I’m nervous, I tell dad jokes. Who do I call about this — my therapist or my comedian?A friend gave me the number of a girl I’d “really dig.” This was his seventh attempt to set me up.

Time to woo.“I’ll take you to the pictures, it’ll last longer.”“...”“Still there?”“Um, yeah.”“Yeah to the pictures thing or being there?”“It’s nope to the pictures thing.”“Dinner maybe?”She exhaled slowly.“Fine.

The loons call from beyond the veil, the water smooth like glass.We pull on tattered caps and you push weather-beaten oars, our poles flush to our sides.The beach has disappeared. “Take these.” You hand me the Styrofoam cup, I wrestle with a worm, and we cast off, reels humming.Soon, your line tugs and goes taught. You grin, wind, and investigate the findings. I pinch my eyes closed.I open my eyes. The water ripples in circles and your catch swims away.

Social Communiqué

Lisa's Choice When new to Facebook, I couldn’t understand why people thought others would give a damn about food items users desperately wanted to share. Still can’t. Perhaps they sought to advertise iPhone photos? Maybe they’d grown up hungry, and wanted to acknowledge Fortuna’s blessings?In hindsight, photographs of café tables, baskets of bread, and food presentations taught me how to acronyms and emoticons. Were my reactions needed or welcome? No. Did digital responses promote self-expression? Absolutely not….Yesterday, my pet goldfish died; I wrote “Final Swim,” an elegy, and posted its photo An hour later, I’d received thirty-nine comments—mostly LOL.

Moonlight Lament
<|story|>
Most weeks, this would be an Editor's Choice. He nervously nibbled cheese, observing her from a distance. Once envious of all she possessed, her celestial beauty, her universal status, now he ached with helplessness. He paced the rocky terrain, past craters as hollow as his heart. Staring into night's black abyss, he reminisced about their shared history. The ebbs and flows, waxing, waning. Ever her devoted stalker, he scrambled back to the telescope. He saw the raging fires, the cataclysmic floods, the imploding warfare. A mournful keening echoed through the Galaxy. The Sun wailed. Brokenhearted, the Man in the Moon witnessed the sorrowful, self-destructive, obliteration of Mother Earth.

Tears pricked my eyes. The older man next to me dabbed his nose with a tissue.Old hymns were sung reminding us of grace, hope, love.We left nourished, comforted, healed.

The Park

A string quartet played as I approached. There was no audience as such, listeners mostly strolling past the gazebo, some sipping wine from clear cups. I came upon her from behind. She wore her hair in an updo with a tortoise-shell barrette, a few wisps left free to frolic in the slight breeze. The style suited her neck. Her shoulder blades were sharp, the skin over them taut, her dress a swirl-patterned flow of orange and yellow, strapless, calf-length. She held her sandals."Mozart and summer," I said in a whisper.She turned her head nearly imperceptibly."Yes.""James.""Catherine."

Magic Moments
<|story|>
Once upon a time in a land of dust and ashes, a garden fairy picked up a flute and played Jean-Pierre Rampal’s version of Genin’s Carnival of Venice. She played with technical precision the triple tonguing, the chromatics, the octave glides and jumps. She floated over the delicate filigrees, the trills, chromatics, and complex fingering. She inspired a chorus of song birds. Bees and butterflies danced to her music. Shrubs and flowers awakened and burst into bud. Leaves fluttered joyfully in rhythm and tempo. Grasses swayed.But in her cocoon of sorrow, the crone neither heard nor saw the magic.

It was her way of coping with things and there was never any violence – well only to cups and cushions.

While standing shirtless, running water through the stain and trying to work out how I dry off again, I see my reflection and realise that I’ve had enough.With shirt still dripping, I re-enter the meeting. Silence falls as they stare at my growing puddle.“Now that I have your attention,” I begin…

“No talent. No imagination!” critics slammed his works of art. One went further: “Calls himself an artist?” He packed up his portfolio of landscape oils, swearing he would never do another exhibition. But how could he give up? Art was in his soul. He stared into a pan of glistening soapsuds when an idea rose and latched onto his mind.Bold colours filled in the background of a new canvas. Translucent bubbles sprung in the foreground, becoming the subject of anyone’s imagination. Paintings flew off his online store in a frenzy— almost as quickly as suds formed in his dishwater.

I wake up to a repeated dull thud—like a beater hitting a kick drum—coming from somewhere. Unlit room; calm interrupted, noisily. “Someone is inside,” Mama whispers, rising hastily. In the kitchen, a fat, grey male cat is scratching, tapping the dustbin—nimble insistency to open the unrelenting lid. Mama stares at me when I burp loudly the fish-curry dinner, and then glances onto the open window. At times, a stray desire walks in through an unguarded opening—rattling, vying for attention. The cat pauses momentarily—overweening, burning gaze fixed on me; before shooing, he saunters away. Eventually, an undue want seeks new harbours.

The Welcome Mat

“You’re the colour of Cadbury’s chocolate,” A small girl by the entry gates to my new school, eyes me curiously.“Yeah, and you’re Nestlé white chocolate,” I snarl.A ball ricochets off braided beads threaded through my black frizz.“Sorry.” A white boy grins sheepishly. “What’s your name?”A group of older girls saunter over, laughing. I anticipate put downs, especially from the blonde.“We wondered how my brother get might grab your attention,” Blondie smiles. “Bet he asks you out. You’re gorgeous and your braids are incredible,”She links arms and I step onto the welcome mat.

As she waited for her number to be called in the bakery, Calliope sneezed into her elbow and felt the glare of the woman next in line.“Why aren’t you wearing a face mask?” the woman hissed.“It’s just allergies,” Calioipe assured her.“Nevertheless,” her linemate said, stepping back several paces, “each sneeze releases 40,000 droplets into the air.”“For your information, I have neither COVID, Flu, nor RSV. Plus, my droplets were released into my elbow,” Calliope replied, feeling both defensive and ridiculous. Was it a rude germophobic confrontation or just Tuesday in the post-pandemic world?

Operational

It explains the windchimes by the windows, the bolts on both doors, front and back, the uncarpeted wooden floors, stairs; not forgetting the hammer within easy reach of her bedside. What we'd thought an old woman's neuroses, verging on the paranoid, were in fact the kind of practical measures taken by any number of long-retired operatives. Miss Stevenson. Who stressed the Miss in preference to Ms. Who sported a hearing-aid that turned out to be a dud, worn for show. Who never strayed beyond generalities concerning the weather. She of the mismatched shoes, all seeming, it turns out.

What Made Utopia Practicable

Testicles, the courts finally agreed, were a pre-existing condition, covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Minimal Health Care for All, Even Men legislation. Treatable, through insurance.But the phallus, the shaft itself, that was Willful Misconduct. Concealed Carry Without a Permit. Possessing the Tools of a Crime.Evolutionary Philosophy had made a clear case for the legal position that male genitalia -- while once useful, even necessary -- were now simply a drag on human development.The way forward was crystal clear.It's a beautiful thing when the Law and Science come together.

Slow to Notice Change
<|story|>
Sometimes things change so slowly that you hardly notice them.But I sure don’t remember this steep mountain range in my backyard, that active volcano flaring up, nor the giant sloth hanging from a nearby tree. Somewhere off in the distance I can see (and feel) the thundering of a woolly mammoth stampede. My neighbor always looked like a Neanderthal to me, so that isn’t new. Although I don’t remember him wearing a fur wraparound outfit, or breaking nuts with a stone axe. Over our now vine-covered fence, he nods at me and grunts hello, I guess.

Driving the Plot Forward
<|story|>
Lisa's Choice I'm almost home when I get stuck behind another red light. I retrieve from the passenger seat that book my teen daughter gifted me.She called it "sci-fi that tackles themes of isolation and alienation." In the protagonist's society, shared spaces are outlawed and people move about in their own mechanical pods.Typical YA junk, nothing in common with real life. The light turns green and I turn onto a street in my subdivision, honking my horn at the lone jaywalker getting in the way of my car.

He’s clearly an expert, for my “yeah” cues strings of anecdotes about his travels in Asia.“Please stop,” I think but am too polite to say.“Ah, we’re boarding!” he says mid-story, springing up like a 20-year-old to get to the front of the queue.Relieved, I get on the plane and walk to my seat, 48C.“Ah, we meet again!” pipes a voice from 48D.“Now, where was I? Ah, yes, my trip to Tokyo in ‘73 …”.

Summer Concert

An outdoor concert in summer. How lovely. The star of the show, dressed in a stylish grey suit, was amazing his audience with his versatility. While the other singers only sang in one style, this star was able to go from jazz to heavy metal, opera to mellow pop, and suddenly throw in a stunning riff. The tonal variation was remarkable and the wide repertoire was exciting, surprising. The audience couldn't wait to hear what he would sing next.With a final flourish, the concert came to an end. "Bravo! Encore!" called the audience, but the mockingbird just flew away.

Unfrozen

It's the heatwave's fault. There was an overload on the grid, the lights went off, flicked back on seconds later, but my deep-freezer threw a tantrum and died. The technician couldn't help; it's a Sunday and he answered my call from the comfort of his deckchair. (I could hear seaside noises in the background). He told me to empty it, defrost it, leave it unplugged for an hour. It didn't work. 'Then leave it unplugged overnight,' he sighed. 'Try again tomorrow.'Tomorrow I'll buy a new one. After I've buried the cadaver that's leaked all over my kitchen floor.

The Butterfly Effect

I can’t say I wasn’t warned.In my favourite short story, Ray Bradbury’s The Sound of Thunder, one tiny incident in history – accidentally trampling on a butterfly – has untold impact on the future.Today, the television shows me daily lynchings and the widespread rule of gun law. There’s a curfew: police shoot to kill anyone on the streets during the darkness hours. Women are mere cooks, home-managers and sex toys for men. No one is safe.Yesterday, my personal failure to do one tiny thing led to this.There is no tomorrow, because I’ll never get another chance to vote.

He longed to be there someday, in a space suit looking over the stars, witnessing the shimmering rings of Saturn, the cobalt chill of Neptune, the talcum rock of Mercury.“Son, your head is in the clouds again when it should be in books!” A man barked as he seized the boy's wrist.Losing grip of the seed, his dewdrop broke.

The timer buzzes.“Ready?” you ask.I nod.We push off, run as fast as we can, and dive under the waves.

She watched the crow circle over her garden, cautiously approach, teeter-totter in landing, with one foot folded underneath, the other hopping to find stability.

The rattling and clattering of the heavy lid enraging the voices still further. For now, I can keep the lid on.For now.

I could look in the understairs cupboard and gaze at your gin bottles.Or that bag of "'clothes for the charity shop" at the back of your wardrobe: I wonder what hidden treats I might find there?Are you ready to negotiate?

Edith
<|story|>
Edith lay on her deathbed, listening to the familiar neighbourhood sounds drifting in through the window. She wished someone would visit her. The couple whose daughter she'd saved from moral ruin; the men whose ways she'd tried to correct. The divorcee whose brewery-owning admirer she'd managed to chase off. I've helped so many people, she thought, Yet nobody cares that I'm dying. Her eyes closed around tears. After her funeral, the neighbours held a wake in the pub. 'She'll be spinning in her grave,' laughed the landlord, raising his glass. 'Here's to a future of live and let live.'

While going on stage, my dad's words rang in my ears, "Contests are like battles without bloodshed. To win, be a soldier." Outside the auditorium, I saw my dad. I ran to him with the trophy in my hand. “Look, dad, I have won,” I shouted in excitement. He turned back to face me. What? He was my driver wearing my dad’s most favourite coat. He said, “Your father gave me this coat just a day before his death.”

The Night the Grandfather Clock Died but Not Ronald
<|story|>
Every night, as he watched the old mantle clock’s hands come to the top, signalling the day’s final countdown, Ronald hummed bits of ‘My Grandfather’s Clock’. On the twelfth bong he’d sigh, “not tonight”and retire to his bed.One Friday the clock didn’t strike, the hands couldn’t move, the key wouldn’t wind. As Ronald stared at the dead clock, anticipating his imminent demise, the correct lyrics surfaced. The clock stopped…when the old man died.Not as he’d thought. Word power: substituting ‘when’ for ‘and’ increased his life expectancy. For more about the song, visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Grandfather%27s_Clock

She turned the glass upside down across from her - the International “do not disturb” signal. The g-t was refreshing. She sipped whilst reviewing her notes.A shadow fell across her papers. She glanced up, glared a definitive “move on”, and returned to reading. A broad hand flattened the pages to the table.

When we lost the baobabs and ginkgos, arborists expressed dismay. Humanity only shrugged. Losing the rubber trees caught our attention, mostly because commerce suffered. Then, we lost the mangroves and maples, alders and ashes, figs and firs. Our collective mourning over trees’ ephemeral nature did nothing to bring them back.

They staged a bloodless silent coup via that box, curbing his power.Alas! His henchmen forgot taking over the election booths.

I struggled to the surface once more for the dirty water to cover my eyes, turning the bluest of skies into the darkest shade of dying alone.Still.Grabbed by the softest of hands… breath in my lungs, I was carried to shore, half blind, on the hip a two-piece bikini.“Silly thing… the tide was going out!” Oh, what became of you, my angel?

No Tulips
<|story|>
Lisa's Choice It’s no coincidence the tulips didn’t bloom the first spring after our son moved out. Their scrawny leaves barely emerged from the hard ground. No stem followed, no petals. I miss their Tyrian purple delight.He had planted them en masse under the maple tree when he was thirteen. There was no pattern to their placement, just a jagged ring of flowers that seemed to grow and live independently from one another, much as he did, we did.Not even an early thaw and a persistent sun could draw forth these geophytes. Without him, we all favor sleep.

One last question, Minister.’ John Campbell relaxed. The interview had gone surprisingly well, considering the reporter was from a newspaper fiercely hostile to the government. ‘Some of your colleagues have confessed to extra-marital affairs. Have you ever...?’‘Absolutely not! I would never be unfaithful to my wife.’ He was telling the truth.‘Thank you, Minister.’The next morning Campbell was confronted by his angry wife waving the morning paper at him. The headline read: ‘Minister Denies Extra-Marital Affairs.’Had he ignored the question he knew with sickening certainty the headline would have been: ‘Minister Refuses To Deny Extra-Marital Affairs.’

Cooking in Harmony
<|story|>
Every Sunday, I wake up feeling like a music conductor about to perform a renowned symphony. But instead of music, I'm crafting a simple breakfast—an egg omelet. Melting butter in the pan signaling the keyboards to start. The sizzling butter sets the stage, and when I pour in the whisked eggs, the strings—violins and cellos—join in. A sprinkle of cheese introduces the woodwinds, adding depth to the melody. With diced ham, the brass sections arrive, their notes enhancing the composition. Finally, a dash of salt and pepper brings in the percussion, completing my culinary symphony.

Here. Kit…” before I remembered.

Rather he might attempt to write his story in no more than 100 words, a new format a publisher had dreamed up. Yet even his title, A la Recherche du Temps Perdu, took up six words alone.

I enjoyed my stay at your hotel. I knew I would when I saw the porridge for breakfast, grey and lumpy with a thick skin. In the bathroom I found two species of cockroach that I’d never seen before. One of them is rare and I’ll include it in a scientific paper I’m writing. I have one complaint. The staff were friendly and courteous, nothing was too much trouble. In the light of this I’m forced to give you four stars rather than five. I hope to stay with you again; perhaps by then you will employ less helpful people.

“Don’t argue, idiot.” Liv’s spork-ratio was waning. She viewed life as sporks - a series of jagged prods that spilt her resolve. She started every day with ten sporks, enough to see her to lunch time. By then, she had none left. Spork refilling required idiot-free time, the longer the better. Conversely, the kinder she was, the more sporks she filled. And it had to be genuine kindness – she knew if she was faking it.Her spork-ratio equated to the number of forks she had left to give before she hit someone.

She nestled into his shoulder with each breath growing heavier. He counted them, one by one. He had never thought to do so before.

Endless space.I won’t apologize for wanting something more than a small town life. I will, however, apologize for pawning her inheritance to cover my plane ticket. I’ve got time.

The hot, muggy air coated the room like pancake syrup. The only light came from the open refrigerator door and trapped him like a butterfly on a pin.She was smiling when she asked him, but behind the forced smile lay a menacing dark countenance that threatened to explode at any minute, with possible harmful effects that could disrupt the peace and tranquility that had been the hallmark of their forty-four-year marriage. She pointed a finger as though aiming a curare-tipped crossbow bolt at his chest and asked him again, “Did you eat that last piece of Key Lime Pie?”

Aisle 5
<|story|>
My fingers graze a jar of pasta sauce. Your favourite brand is on sale. All at once I’m victimized by the unexpected poignant moment in aisle 5. Nostalgic for laughing in our galley kitchen as you threw noodles at the wall to check for doneness. You zigging for the bowls, me zagging for the forks. Our well-rehearsed bachata in the narrow space. I never cared much for dancing, not until you, not since you. I squeaky wheel my cart away from the memory and decide to make tacos instead.

Sometime After July 4th
<|story|>
Something peculiar seemed to be happening with time so that when I looked down into the deep red of my wine, I got lost in the infinitely slow process, of picking fruit, from vines planted where Roman Legions once trudged. But then looking up and around the table in the treacherous candlelight, I found the conversation hurtling headlong to a decision made without my participation about my future.Every cigar was cut and lit. Every Cognac glass filled and every chair leaned back in satisfaction from a suitable conclusion for all but me. I would be the next party leader.

Three Heads Are Not Better Than One

I’m an experienced, professional dog-walker with many satisfied customers. But I never expected to have Cerberus (yes, the three-headed giant dog who guards Hell’s Gates) as a client. When we go to the dog park, all the dogs flee for their lives, as they should, since the first time we went there, Cerberus ate three of them at once (he has three mouths, after all). On the street, he frightens everyone we meet and when he pees, it dissolves fire hydrants, trees and building walls.But how could I refuse Hades? He’s giving me a get-out-of-the-Underworld-free pass.

The Oval Altar

We sit silently around the oval altar suspicious of players, heads bowed, hunched over game masters, calculating the odds of success. Old men, mature women, young studs, and young women, bluffers all, experts at their craft. Each with a plan to lay waste on anyone that dare challenge their superiority.Each one has their own tale to share, whether of triumph or of being defeated by misfortune, Moirai, the mother of destiny. Each hidden behind a wall of lies. Platitudes, crooked smiles and a pat on the table. The flop, the turn, the river… a microcosm of winners and fish.

When she saw what her daughter did, all the day’s frustrations reached a boiling point.

Like Me
<|story|>
The cat next door reminded me of my childhood self. How? You ask. Trapped in a home she didn’t want to belong to. Her searingly painful meows would bounce off the houses nearby and slip into my ears. From dusk till nightfall, she would precariously perch on the lip of the balcony. And make her pleading calls for freedom. Blue Point Birman. Magnificent, but melancholic. She escaped dozens of times, unsuccessfully. About a year later, when I moved, she leapt in my car as I loaded it. I didn’t notice. I didn’t return her. She never meowed like that again.

The sons-in-law glanced at each other silently recalling: two weddings, the birth of four grandchildren, numerous holiday gatherings. This time however, Ben paused. He reverently wiped off the bottle, uncorked it and produced three small glasses. “A toast,” his voice shook. “The sweetest wine for my sweetest, most beloved wife.”They raised their glasses.

Patriotic Neologism
<|story|>
No offence, but this German compound word malarkey is a waste of ink, line-space and time. And we need an extra deep breath before speaking. I know I'm biased, but take my language as an example. We need a new word? Simply steal it. Then mispronounce it.Or portmanteau itOr change the ending: We have bounteous endings, both breathtaking and straightforward, so one is destined to fit.If worst comes to worst, just take an existing English word and give it yet another meaning. We have good words, they can take the extra weight.

He watched them scuttle under unwashed crockery, use the stove as an obstacle course, run upside down along the window frames. Shifting on the springless sofa, he tried to find a comfortable position for his hernia, cursing when the doorbell rang. As he stood up, his knees buckled and his hands grabbed at air and random objects for support. The avalanche of unread hardbacks buried him alive.

Believe!

Most people were shocked by the dramatic changes that rapidly unfolded once he took office.Rounding up and deporting immigrants en masse. Prosecuting political rivals. Pardoning criminals. Removing judges. Revoking media licenses. Banning books. Firing and replacing government workers. Using the military to quell protests. Building detention camps. Abandoning allies. Appeasing dictators.Leading up to the election, he’d talked about doing all these things. Yet most voters didn’t expect such things would actually happen because they no longer trusted politicians. Most thought the now new president’s campaign slogan — “Believe!” — was just hype, like an ad for a reality TV show.

Am I awake? Or asleep? Thoughts race so fast each leaves a trail of rainbow colors in its wake. My toes buzz, my head warms. My mouth is as dry as the Dust Bowl in 1930. A bitter-sweet flavor of chocolate lingers. The bed spins. The room spins. But really ... am I dreaming or am I awake? My eyes seem to be closed; I have a close-up view of the inside of my eyelids.When I “wake” in the morning, it's like coming in for a landing.Man, this stuff is nothing like what we got in the sixties.

First sighting of the sun for weeks. Jim and Babs drive to the nearest garden centre, elbow their way to the perennials, pick up plastic trays of lobelias. “Perfect for hanging baskets,” Babs declares. Jim spots a patio furniture set. “Good value that,” he states. Babs nods. They grab random seed packets, berry bushes and tomato plants, imagining being self-sufficient.

Premier Match

The captain of the home team has scored four goals this season (all penalties) and had eleven assists. At the cusp of halftime he draws two defenders and volley-kicks the ball to the lanky Number 10. Goal! Strutting off the pitch, a stud stallion. (Some womenfolk clamorously indicate availability.) Different picture, later. At the 82nd minute the home team is down 2-1, but there’s a penalty now. The captain expertly sends the goalie to the right, then hits the left post. Defeat. Dragging himself off the field, head lowered, a dejected clown. Shape-shifting thrice, geometric chameleon.

Pray for guidance,” was the answer.When the son arrived, Blanca had an idea. She’d heard she’d get a green card if she married a citizen. “Call me George,” the friendly man said. Si, Senora, Helen, Blanca thought. Prayer is powerful.

Regretful Ordeals
<|story|>
I maxed out a credit card after stealing a prom dress at the mall, security followed me, said please come with us, then sitting across from me at their formidable desk said pay this fine, it won’t be reported to the police, you seem remorseful. I applied for a credit card on my parents computer, miraculously approved the perfect amount to pay for my consumerist sin.The ordeal remains on my Experian report, ugly interest, I forgot to pay the monthly, my mind ruminating on gut-punches from my ex, hair pulling, how he spit on me, and stole my time.

Cold Comfort
<|story|>
I’m on a new painkiller. It is to alleviate the discomfort of compressed nerves. My doctor said that the medication is connected to my brain to deaden the pain.I now have the disconcerting habit of starting conversations without segues which seems to confuse people as they have no hinterland to my stories. I have the same problem with jokes which are not funny, upsetting people.This morning I started to write drabbles again and to my horror the words on my iPad were so jumbled that autocorrection couldn’t sort them out. My back pain’s gone but my Brian’s confused.

Sparrows chattered. Neighbourhood children frolicked under a beaming sun. Nancy smiled, seeing her favourite fellow wildly shaking a rubber chicken. Next time she glanced from behind a window, he was gone. The gate had been opened.Years later, a stranger phoned. He had reason to believe that someone belonging to her was spotted five-hundred miles away from where she lived.Her retriever, Riley, was returning home.

Solitude and Stories
<|story|>
It was not a deciduous but permanently denuded tree. Once, it used to be a dense growth to please wanderers and workers. Gradually, it withered and became a neglected thing like me. It haunted me and cruelly reminded me of my worthlessness.That night, a sage appeared in my dream and uttered, “Words, words, words.” The next was a fateful day for me. I picked a lot many words and sowed them into the fallow soil of my solitude. Within a few months, a lush green crop of stories emerged to please thousands of wonderers. The tree stopped haunting me.

Wolf Song
<|story|>
Staring into the golden eyes of the wolf at the Sanctuary and hearing the resident wolves raise their voices in song was chilling. Had my message had been transmitted?A week later; 702 miles away: “Wolf song uninterrupted in Daniel, Wyoming, In an unprecedented display, wolves have circled Cody Robert’s’ home and howled for six days. Roberts remains trapped. On 29th February 2024, Roberts ran down a yearling wolf with his snowmobile, muzzled, leashed, and dragged the gravely wounded animal by a shock collar into a pub where she was tortured for several hours before her death.”Only half fantasy!

All Dressed Up And Somewhere To Go

I beam back at him. ‘Best place on Earth.’I scrape my hair into a ponytail and unclip my earrings, thankful I decided against wearing a long dress this time.The coach driver gently nudges me awake; I step down into the chilly early morning mist. It’s a short walk uphill. She comes straight to the door and takes me in her arms.

I will stop all immigration, remove all gun controls, deport all blood-sucking leeches and use our great traditions to make this the most powerful, the most wealthiest, the most…’Shots rang out and the king slumped to the ground. There was also a tradition that malcontents occasionally expressed disapproval of their country’s leader.

Notes from an Exhibition
<|story|>
Dates stones were sewn onto a useless canvas made for shelter, now in shreds, one for each day of the conflict. Rows of baby’s milk bottles filled with anything but milk; sand, bullets, seeds, sticks, rubble. Some had no teats; others were charred having been thrown clear of bomb-blasted buildings. I didn’t come in for this. Next door in a beautiful house is a collection of antique furniture, landscape scenes, portraits, and sculptures. Sea shells and pebbles make tranquil designs for lazy sunlit cornices. Meanwhile, I cannot remove from my mind, the image of a push-chair crushed by shelled masonry.

A Chef's Journey
<|story|>
Gordon's Choice I pick up a knife with one hand and take a look at the other, readying the claw hands I’ve been using since adolescence. The difference is that I am now center stage in the greatest restaurant in Vegas. I review the shallots on the cutting board, ready for our signature Beef Wellington. A few swift chops and then a bunch of diced shallots. I have done this countless times, but the slicing and dicing still reminds me of my first time, in my immigrant parent’s kitchen, a YouTube cooking channel on my phone. The journey was long, but worthwhile.

If caught, perhaps torture, or death…They waited another 15 minutes."Could I volunteer #67?""I'm with #33. I'd like to volunteer #67, Chief."Relieved, the old man dismissed the two agents. 13 minutes later, #67 knocked on his door."Sorry I'm so late, Chief.""Good to see you, #67."​

Freedom

The man in the Hi-Viz vest walks across the roof of the tower block. He stands at the edge. He’s had enough of the people who do not hear him when he speaks. Had enough of the work boots on his feet. He takes a final breath. “It’s a long way down.”He turns his head.“Think of the mess.”The small boy speaking is wearing a Hi-Viz vest, dungarees and work boots, unlaced.“I have known you…”“I’m you, many years ago.” The boy smiles.Sam steps back and begins to cry.“There is freedom in forgiveness, Sam.”

Overheard

“Well, if I was in charge, I wouldn’t bother trying to talk to them. I’d just blast ’em to bits.” The lad jabbed his beer can at his mates. “Who needs ’em?”“Some might be friendly,” another one said.“Nah, destroy ’em all.”Albert took his wife’s arm and led her away from the group.“Did you hear that?” His eyes had narrowed with fury. “That’s hate speech. He’s encouraging people to blast OAPs to bits.”His wife frowned. “I think you misheard, dear. He didn’t say OAPs, he said UAPs. Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena. We used to call them UFOs.”

At the end of the evening, in the garage or restroom, the men removed their sparkles and glitter and wiped their faces clean of makeup. They stepped through the hotel doors into quotidian society, counting the days until they could inhabit their authentic selves again.

Lonely Planet Guide
<|story|>
At last I can go wherever I want to go. This week I am accompanying Keats; island hopping in the Cyclades, vicariously exploring those realms of gold. Last month with Bauby as my guide I stayed closer to home and enjoyed fish and chips on a windswept harbour wall and watched the sunset. For once money is not a consideration; neither are time or conflicting commitments. Distractions to my travel plans are few on the third floor; the lack of a lift keeps unwanted interruptions at bay. I never go anywhere on Thursdays, unless the rota is altered.

The cold hospital room was lit by morning’s soft and forgiving glow. The neurosurgeon was forthright.“Right now, you still have choices,” he spoke in a slow, reassuring cadence. “With the time you have left, you can be with your family. I know how important that is for you.”A nurse monitored his heartbeat, which was elevated slightly. The fever had finally broken, and his appetite returned. He saw his wife near the window. The light shimmered around her.“You look like an angel.” She turned around as if falling to earth.

Even on her most trying days, their grace and elegance always brightened her spirits.During the visits with our "friends,” as she called them, she would say, “They’re just like us, perfectly matched for life.”Every time she said that it brought tears to my eyes because we knew our time together would soon end.After her funeral, I went back to the park.

One door each on either side of the stage. The magician would appear at one, toss a ball towards the other, and go back inside. The next instant, he would come out of the other and catch the ball. Nobody knew that the magicians were twins. This would be their magnum opus.Wearing identical red shirts they hid behind the two doors. The trick proceeded as planned. But instead of applauding, the audience started booing, "Oh come on.. one of you has green polka dots on the red shirt". That's when the magicians realized that they were both colour blind.

Cruel Carrots

'Eat your carrots then you'll be able to see in the dark.'So I do, forcing them into me not because I crave nocturnal vision but because the doctor's put me on a low-calorie diet. I swig carrot juice for breakfast, too. Bland supper over, I go to bed to fantasize over recipe books in the privacy of my room. I fall asleep hungry and wake up at four, starving. I creep into the kitchen, swearing quietly because the light bulb's broken. Yet, strangely, I can see quite well. Especially the chocolate cake my flatmate's forgotten on the worktop.

The Painting

Hanging on a wall in a national gallery in some unpronounceable country, located on an even more unpronounceable street, is a painting everyone needs to see. Not because it is pretty to look at. It is not. In fact, critics the world over have described it as rather pedantic.What makes it both unique and priceless is the fact that it was painted on a mirror, giving the casual observer insight into more than mere paint on a canvas.After much debate it is now known as a ‘Destroyer of Souls’ by non-believers or the ‘Savior of Life’ by hopefuls.

Lost Causes

My mother was a lefty protester who could have won the Worst Gift Giver contest hands down. For Christmas she gave us expired boxes of Stove Top Stuffing, sheets of gold star stickers with a few stars missing, toy rubber giraffes, a single tarnished spoon. When my daughter turned 15, a package arrived in the mail. I will never forget the look on her face as she unwrapped the present to find a set of tiny wooden clothes pins, each one no bigger than an almond. My mother had carefully written NO NUKES with a black pen on each one.

The Aurora Symphonia

A midnight kayak paddle in the phosphorescent water of Lough Hyne turned even more magical. An Aura of light magnificently painted the sky with colours capturing the solar storm. The sky shimmered undulations of purple and green. For a love-sick lonesome Jim, still reeling from a messy divorce, it awakened the image of a lone female pianist, on a cold Arctic shore filled with musical mist. He was drawn trance-like with no discernible propulsion towards the rapids of Barloge Creek by the melody that drowned out the percussive crash of the turbulent Atlantic waves, and out towards the endless Ocean.

They earned that seven dollars the hard way.Wednesday night came. Seven dollars. Burger. Chips. Soda.“Well?”“McDonald’s is better.”

Food’s a bit short back up in the forest so I slink into town for a feed.Scavenge a main meal from a McDonald’s skip, a tasty burger followed by dessert, a half jar of honey from a garbage bin. Snout digs in deep, tongue cleans it out.Back to the forest where a big old grizzly looms from the trees. Sniffs the air…honey. I cringe. Old grizzly lunges down, tongue slobbers at my nose. He shuffles away.Guess he just wanted dessert, not a main meal.

Supreme Leader
<|story|>
As your newly-elected Supreme Leader, I’m delighted to put to bed those wicked rumours from my traiterous, lying opponents. I was always innocent, as 99.99% of you, the people, have demonstrated in a free and fair election.My first act in government is to delete Fridays. Everyone will appreciate working a shorter week – nobody bothered on Fridays, anyway – and six-day weeks mean each birthday will come around every 312 days rather than 365. More birthdays will generate more celebration activity, and boost the economy.Best of all, we’ll all live 11% more years. All except those who disagree, who won’t.

Going Back
<|story|>
“They’re building houses in the Peasy Woods!”He watches from the deck as the vessel inches away from the pier, slowly, delicately. It’s been years since he’s been on the ferry. Years and a lifetime ago. He’s built a life of accomplishment in the intervening period, free from the past. A life he’s proud of.All that means, though, is that he just has more to lose.“I’m not moving it alone! You need to get back here!!”He keeps on reading the texts as the ferry enters open water, wondering why past mistakes can’t just stay buried.

Where There Is No Music
<|story|>
Once upon a time, in a land of unrelenting sorrow, a crone sat on her front stoop yelling vulgarities into the morning.Two witches heard her screams. “Ouch!” said Prima. “Stop that noise.”“Grandmother is stone deaf,” said Secunda. “Let’s teach her to be a lute string … to resonate joyfully when touched … to hum when doors are slammed.”“Ah, but even lute strings snap!” Prima reminded.Secunda sighed. “’True. Yet, lute strings break only when they cease being mindfully grateful for the brush of fingers.”“Then let the mindfully grateful BE the music!” said Prima.Thus it was.

Respite
<|story|>
Yesterday, the sun snuck into the fibres of my sneakers, imbuing them with a mischievous giggle that traversed my being tickling the “grumpies” out of me, coaxing a smile from my post middle-aged mouth.How it knew to meep my metaphorical nose I’ll never know, but it pulled the hectic out of me like a piece of soft taffy. For a few moments, I savoured warm toes in old runners and the sweet serenity of my sunflower face rising to meet its namesake…Then, I walked to my car with sunlight draining from my shoes, looking at my to-do list.

The Weatherman
<|story|>
The morning was serene with clear winnowed air. Armed with a baton atop the church spire he began to conduct. Soon grey clouds rose with faint and rare mutterings like Carmina Burana. Sunshine died as sultry leaden skies shrouded the town flashing threads of blue. The earth waited breathlessly for some wild blow. Swifts flew aimlessly beneath the maelstrom like crotchets. His arms grew animated and the kettle drum roll of thunder broke within the hollow circle of the hills with electric thrills. The aria reached its crescendo, as the deluge refreshed vineyard irrigation runnels for another prime wine year.

Watching from the Shadows
<|story|>
I never liked that corner of my room. The corner where he would appear, like clockwork, night after night. His tall, thin frame would lurk there, near the doorway, absorbing the darkness.Blacker than black. A sinister silhouette of shadow.And though I could never see his face, make out his features in the dark of night, I knew he was watching. Staring. With empty eyes, searching my soul. Never moving. Just glued to thatcorner until sunrise.But even when the light of day whisked him away, smoky and dark, I could still feel them. Those eyes watching me.

Guard the Gate
<|story|>
I told them to guard the gate. I was persistent. They assured me. There were loud bangs on the gate. Those were persistent too. They were guarding the gate. There were bangs on the gate. It was all enveloped in a thick fog. Sometimes there was rain, washing the thick blanket of fog. Sometimes there was rain. Sometimes. One day, the banging stopped, forever. I searched for the guard. He allowed me one question and promised to answer truthfully and satisfactorily but in one word. I asked his name.

Birthday Countdown
<|story|>
“What do you want for your birthday?” Rachel asked at breakfast. “I’m not having any more birthdays,” Howard said.“Why?”“I’ve lived more years than I have years left to live. Birthdays are a countdown to death and destruction. A birthday means you have one less year to live. Who wants to celebrate that?” “I see your point. It makes sense.” Then she said, “So...what do you want?”Howard grinned. “A Harley Davidson motorcycle with a hot babe on the back.”“The hot babe on back would be me.”“This is going to be the best birthday ever,” said Howard.

It was the old gold coin hidden behind the seat cushions.She only made ten dollars on the sofa.

Sunk Cost

Gordon's Choice Greg has botched another surgery. It’s no surprise really. He may have the skill and knowledge, but he lacks the mind: once something goes wrong he panics and things just snowball from there. Perhaps another career would suit him better, but to call it quits after four years of medical school, five years residency and $270,000 in student loan debt… That’s an investment. It’s certainly… easier to encourage a bit of sloppiness in the autopsy by shooting me a little bribe.​Still, I have to keep some standards. He gets one body a month, after that he’s on his own.

Cherry Jam
<|story|>
Sometimes, being an editor just takes your breath away. Quite literally, after I'd read the story above and selected it as my worthy Editor's Choice, this was the very next one to arrive – Gordon Nothing makes sense in this street: every fence is riddled with bullet holes, and the fragments of walls hold remnants of roofs like funny hats. People ant around the jigsaw puzzles of their blasted lives, still trying to keep the pattern. Their children play war, screaming, shooting plastic guns and calling each other Putin.I stand in my father’s shattered backyard, plucking cherries. So big, sweet and meaty, I can’t help crying silently into my palms. Because it doesn’t make sense. They are so delicious this summer, so exceptionally good, but no one is left to make the cherry jam.

The Power of Prayer
<|story|>
Delta Terminal, LaGuardia, late 1970s. Nick remembers. Amid the arriving throng, he inched ahead. Next to him, a balding businessman, in gray suit, striped tie hanging over paunch, clutching his weathered briefcase, remarked: “Hard to believe this. Every day. Why’d you come?”“I’m here searching for my son. My ex-wife is hiding him.”The man halted, took Nick’s elbow: “I’ll pray you find him.”“Thank you.”Shaking hands, they parted. In good time, Nick found his boy. He doesn’t know about a higher power. Only the power he projects each day, praying for all who are lost, sick, troubled, dying.

First Day on the Job
<|story|>
His hands were sweaty and he fidgeted his feet. He was wearing a very nice blue suit. Even though the night was cool and he had taken a shower in the military tent, his armpits were wet. In his mind, he rehearsed his short welcome speech. Suddenly, the door of the spaceship opened. The strong light from within blinded him. All soldiers around took their positions. Then, the strange-looking alien came down the ramp, crawled to him and extended its viscous tentacle. With fear and disgust, he took the tentacle in a strange imitation of a handshake.“Welcome to Earth!”

Eileen
<|story|>
Eileen's ninetieth winter was the hardest, and it was the last. Gales rattled the windows and the frost wrote her grudges on the inside of the glass. Cocooned in bitterness, she closed her eyes. It was summer when the landlord blundered into the top floor flat, his master key rusty from lack of use. 'No rent, no home,' he snapped. 'Pack up and leave.'Eileen sat in her armchair, cobwebs up her nostrils and moths between her lips. The front door slammed shut, the latch clicked into place and a swarm of flies rose from her lap to greet him.

Drummossie Moor, site of the last pitched battle fought on British soil. The place where the British lost only a handful of men yet massacred more than a thousand Scots. ​Now the only reminders of the infamous Battle of Culloden are the rocky monuments to those whose blood drained into the soil on that fateful day.It’s hard to imagine swords and dirks flashing and slashing red coats and patterned tartans nor that such slaughter took place on this peaceful, misty moor. But if you listen carefully, you’ll hear the dying skirl of the bagpipes carried on the mournful wind.

Our Neighbor Up The Creek
<|story|>
I kayak up our tidal creek through milkweed down and fallen leaves looking for the elusive nest of the great blue heron.Using the paddle as a pole, I navigate a narrow channel through snail-dotted marsh grass and hear an unseen bird singing exotically in a canopy of live oaks. I imagine floating on Kipling's great grey-green greasy Limpopo River all set about with fever trees. And abruptly run aground. Mosquitoes find me and feast. Annoyed by my intrusion, the great blue heron squawks a scolding then spreads its wide wings and gracefully soars skyward. The moment is awesomely magnificent.

Slowly, like an Indian about to slit a farmer’s throat, he inches closer then spears it quickly, lifting its twitching body out of the water.As he cuts off the legs, the old bull male winks at Tommy.“Jesus, that’s creepy,” I say.

For a while, he was the dominant voice in his post-university social group: the bestowers of the nickname.As he turned to environmentalism, though, that voice spoke too many awkward truths. And thus, like protons and neutrons being shed by a once-stable atom, the friends slipped away.Now he was called Brian.

They would gladly accept my rain clouds to satiate their thirst, quench their parched fields and to help invigorate their listless livestock. It would be a blessing for them.Perhaps it must be that wherever we are, whatever we do, whether we're happy or sad often depends upon...the weather.

But you don’t say anything, not wanting to be that woman who publicly complains, and the driver does look young though doesn’t everyone these days? He holds the large steering wheel loosely, as if he is made of rubber, bobbing his head around, rarely looking forward. You are on the side lurching toward the asphalt and feel the wheel’s rim scraping the highway that’s chewing up the desiccated tire. "A bus doesn’t just keel over," you incant for three hours to New York City and when you arrive, a man in the back says,"By the grace of God." Home.

My smile turns upside down. “What?” he asks.I push away from him and slowly paddle around the pool. The plump woman joins a jowly man with a sunburnt face. He whispers in her ear.

I am standing in my skis, tips sticking over the edge. I know the things you can do to me. You are not a straight-down-fall-to-your-death kind of drop.

The snow bunched up just the right way, under a ski turned just the wrong way. I wonder for a moment how I might avoid you. I slap myself in the face. “Huck and pray.” That’s what my daughter would say. I slide forward.

In July of last year, the UN Chief, on the advice of the climate-scientists, coined the term “Global Boiling”, discarding the clichéd “Climate Change”.

Wishful Stones

They could’ve been for her: words or pictures of hope painted on stone.She read as many as she could, walking by, swallowing tears. “You can do it, don’t lose hope, love you forever…”She paused at those for grandparents, remembering her own; the long-distance commutes to visit them, Grandma waiting outside for the family’s arrival, dinner aromas pulling them indoors where Grandpa sat, cane by his side.She wondered how many, for whom the messages were intended, had survived their illnesses…as she passed the bed of stones by the entrance of a cancer centre, for her own treatment.

There were three of them, dressed all in black, sauntering aimlessly around a hundred yards away. They shouldn’t have bothered me, but I committed the mistake of making eye contact.Very gradually, they began to approach me. Their unblinking eyes never left mine. Silently, threateningly, they circled me, seemingly at random while drawing inexorably nearer. I was about to be robbed, but was powerless to do anything. The tension was unbearable.Sometimes, discretion is the better part of valour. Unable to stand it any longer, I fled, leaving my fish supper behind as the crows swept in for their swag.

Trespasser

Gordon's Choice On the northern edge of the forest, a wolf howls. The fire crackles and spits as I sit crosslegged staring into the flames, hunched and shivering. A twig snaps, then another. My heart begins to thump so hard it must surely be heard by whatever is approaching. A shuffle of leaves close behind; I pull my hunting knife, ready to thrust it home. A gust of wind whips up the flames as I turn to face the unfortunate intruder. Piggy eyes lock onto mine. ‘Oink, oink,’ I mumble. He blinks and trundles onwards, snuffling softly, until the darkness swallows him.

From her moth eaten petticoats she procured the bottle, her keen eyes raked over the patrons save they hear his accurate but unwelcome personifications. Damn the church and their ignorance towards her livelihood. “Bury it the North garden.” She ordered. “No tricks then Witch? It works?” “Aye.” She told him as cheers burst up from the nearby table. Fetid fingernails scratched at his wicked smile and Lenora shrank away even further. “Tis fortuitous.” Gavin sneered. “What is?” “I told Father Peter that he need not clear the pyre.”

Too late, Ray glimpsed a shape hurdle from the darkness, slam onto their grill and hood, twisting antlers scraping the windshield. The gray, furred, somersaulting hulk thudded on their roof, bounced off the boot, lay motionless on the pavement behind.“Damn. I’ll have to kill it.” Ray reached for his wrench set.

Higher productivity benefits the common good and, indirectly, his family too.Now several decades later, living in a foreign country two thousand miles away from the land, he still remembers the smell of the soil. The soil - which now carries paved roads, luxury condos, timeshares, but no crops - still remembers their primitive hoes.

The police siren. My rear window glared, flashing red lights.

The Grief that Knows no Silence
<|story|>
You can’t stop it or replace it with something less painful. It hammers a hole in your heart and settles down for the duration.Maybe a cookie will help. But it doesn’t and you vomit quietly in the backyard.Anger replaces the dark pain. Fist against door frame, foot against top stair. Maybe you broke your toe.The small house with a red roof is still there. You crawl in, pull the old blanket with “My Doggy” hand stitched in blue thread around you. Maybe you can dream together of the best wild days with the Frisbee in the park.

The Privilege of Getting Swole
<|story|>
My son’s friends are bigger than me. They pound into the kitchen ransacking the pantry - dropping mud clods from their shoes and crumbs from their PowerBars. They’re a pack of gym-obsessed; hormone-fueled scavengers. I go to the gym more now too. I'm desperate to keep beating Henry at arm wrestling for just a while longer. We both laugh as our biceps strain and our eyes bulge but he’s gaining ground. My wife thinks Henry will be at least 5’ 11’’. A good height we agree and think of the weeks we watched him hooked to tubes in the NICU.

Gotta Go
<|story|>
The moonlight falls in strips across the gaping toilet. I stare down at the tooth shapes on the porcelain rim, at the dark hole in the basin. My bladder is bursting.I turn and sit, exposed and exhausted. The lid hits my back. I reach behind and push it away. I sigh as half a litre of white wine exits my body.The lid hits me again, hard. It presses down, folding me. My thighs are pierced, and again. Something wet caresses from below, catches my liquids. It masticates. I scream, then gurgle, as I descend into the dark whirlpool.

Laura shrieked as Jordan staggered through the farmhouse doorway, flushed and panting.‘You wouldn’t believe it,’ he spluttered, ‘I almost got mauled by a bull! Came at me out of nowhere in that field with the short cut.’‘He’s servicing the cows, babe. But Dad said he’d put a warning notice up.’‘There’s no notice. Oh God, my Gucci jeans are ruined—look, the rips don’t match now! And my hair’s a total disaster!’Down in the valley Farmer Williams chuckled as he screwed the sign carefully back onto the gate. ‘Cocky blighter can run, I’ll say that for ‘im.’

Liquidated
<|story|>
They call everyone into the main office. Even the skirt from reception has to stand with us welders. Howard walks in. His swanky shirt is creased and sweat drips from his wrinkled forehead. He removes his glasses."There is no easy way to tell you this. We have been screwed up the wrong-un by Barclays. We have ceased trading."Before anyone can argue, he clasps his hairy chest and moans loudly. The factory loses power. A mass of pencil pushers descend over the yard, their clipboards clattering in unison. We grab our heaviest hammers, and run downstairs to face them.

A Slight Miscalculation
<|story|>
She watched him hem and haw, then pace and fume, making disturbing noises through his nose, apparently showing his utter disdain for the whole thing.She said, “What are you doing?”“Huh?” He turned a vacant stare toward her with little effect.She asked again, “What are you doing?”“I’m venting. Isn’t it obvious?”“Yes, but why?”“My eighty-eighth birthday.”“What about your birthday?”“No one has called or sent a card, text, or email. No one cares.”“I’m sure they will on the proper day. You’re looking at last month’s calendar.”“I knew that. It was only a test.”

I won’t waste it.”He gave me a hug and said, “Bless you. See you later.”I went to pay the cashier. Hmm. Where did my wallet go?

That's All
<|story|>
“That's all?”The cashier looked at Ed. Three eggs looked pitiful, and he anticipated her displeasure at the sight of the coins. Ed often delayed spending them, unable to ruin the beauty of the precise numbers. He also saw no reason to buy more eggs then he needed for his breakfast.Enthralled by the sound of coins, Ed dove into one of his enchanted states.“You are five cents short, “ the cashier said.Ed grabbed the counter for support.“That couldn't be,” he muttered, but the cashier busied herself and Ed left the shop.

A Screaming Comes Across the Sky
<|story|>
We stand in the yard, mouths agape, eyes wide, trying to find the origin of the piercing cry. The screaming stops as quickly as it began. We move closer together, huddle in a knot, arms intertwined, heads swivelling to and fro, trying to spot something. Anything, really. Trying not to catch one another's eye, lest we see our own fears reflected and then amplified, fear building and running away with us. Minutes feel like hours and then like seconds, folding and unfolding in time with our ragged breath. Just as our grip on one another loosens, the scream comes again.

And after the dish ran away with the spoon, it didn’t last (no surprise there), and the playboy dish had a cute little saucer on the side until the spoon found out and cracked the plate a good one. The cat? He became a successful country musician.

Her hair in a loose plait over her shoulder. There was no spark of colour, no intensity, only a stillness on a muggy morning."Good morning, sis" he called as he crossed to her."I lost the baby. Again" she stated as she raised her pale eyes to him.

“Daddy’s tired,” Mom said, “don’t wake him.” She repeated this mantra like a looped recording. He slumbered during our days at school and throughout our fatherless evenings, never leaving his room. His absence swelled into years.On her deathbed, Mom took my hand. “There’s something I must confess. Your dad passed years ago. I couldn’t afford to bury him, so I mummified him and kept him upstairs.”“What?” I cried, horrified. “Why did you wait until now to tell me?”“Because,” she said sadly, “I knew it would upset you, and because . . . he comes with the house.”

Embers
<|story|>
You were only seven the last time I saw you. Late that summer night. Our parents warned us never to tread through the woods on the way home. On the short, dirt path. But, it was a faster way, I’d convinced myself. And so, we disobeyed.How thick the fog was—clouding any sign of stars. Yet, through the mist, you swore you saw fireflies. Shimmering. You went ahead, following each of their flickers. To that clearing. That circle of trees. I heard you laughing, calling my name. And then, you were gone. In a flash of embers. In fireflies.

Rage

Tears flow, my heart breaks. Is there enough glue at my core to hold myself together?I want to scream, to stamp my feet.  My vision contracts into a shaded tunnel, I rage, rage against the dying of the light.I cannot find the place where I buried my anger.  My body is an archeological site.  I dig carefully - handpick, chip brush, screen sieve.

The Miser and Macaroni

Gordon's Choice He'd stolen a packet of macaroni from the Refugee Centre (wretched foreigners, scrounging benefits) and cooked it the minute he got home, the blaring television his only witness. Hissing from the stove coincided with a war reportage. Annoyed with both, he killed the flame but the pasta kept swelling, toppling from the saucepan onto the floor, and the more he swept it up, the more there was.

Children

What are they doing here? In the ghost town of rusty cars, broken roads, of shredded high rises with elevator cables dangling in the drafts like guts of a dead dragon. They huddle in the cellars and say that their parents are “there”, dab at the bricks with twigs and glance at the black smoke rising over the horizon. A woman in the street drags a sleepy toddler by the hand and talks on the phone. “I think it’s time, but I don’t want to leave.” The next morning, a missile leaves a crater in the asphalt, where she spoke.

Wildest Dreams

What she saw when she looked out the window was hell. The Earth was on fire, with light-blazing automobiles for embers and illuminated skyscrapers as leaping flames.How had it got to be this way? And what might she be looking at instead, this evening, if human brains, deep in evolutionary history, had stayed smaller? If their influence had not become so pervasive?Curling herself back into her low bed, she slipped uneasily into a state of half-sleep and a lush green land that she roamed on four paws.

Human Transit

The city, where she’d lived for forty years, was drained of wonder. Sometimes, during the lurching, heaving bus rides between work and home, she thought about her childhood, how she sat beside her father during long drives through the country, and how the road ahead of them unfurled like a ribbon wrapping the earth. Miles in the distance she could see it curl over a hilltop before disappearing into the horizon, and she imagined if she ever reached that place – where the ribbon touched the sky – she’d see her future sparkling before her, awaiting her arrival.

Death By Powerpoint

“Words damaged pictures” the lecturer began before elaborating. “The wonderful thing about pictures….” Here a slide of Hopper's Nighthawks appeared on the screen.My writer's imagination began to invent context and justify the scenario. The voyeur's viewpoint of the lonely reality we all have regardless of where we live.“…. Is that you can have ambiguity in a way that you can’t so easily with words, they are an alternative to the conventional conversation, more complex, more subtle, more realistic than open-mindedness.”His words droned on without conclusion, contrary to the evidence before us, which ravaged my writers' inspiration.

Never Assume

Heeding some unspoken cue, the elderly couple seated across from me instinctively joined hands as their eyes spoke softly in a well-understood shorthand gained from decades of shared experience. Their simple wedding bands, no doubt, belied their emotionally prosperous union.Although we were in the cancer center's cafe, I felt like an interloper. But when they saw me, they just smiled.“I’ve heard the oncologists here are wonderful,” I said, trying to minimize the intrusion.“Oh, we’re not patients,” she said. “I've been cancer-free for years. We only come back now for the coffee; the barista makes great cappuccino.”

WINNERSIDERIUS CLASSIC 100-WORD​COMPETITION, 2024 "You don't know me," she said. I guess I didn't. I never really had, of course. Children are torn from your body, their thoughts their own. "No, I don't," I said, my back pressed against the bathroom door. On the other side, she stifled a sob, and my heart broke. "Oh, honey..." I said, slipping my fingers under the door, just the tips on the other side. She sniffled. Then I felt the soft pressure of her small warm fingers on mine. We sat there, back to back, fingers to fingers, until I heard the soft click of the lock.

The jurors looked away, at their feet, the ceiling, anywhere but at the judge or the victim’s family. This case was not a mistrial. Nor was it thrown out on a technicality. How can five eyewitness testimonies, three corroborating CCTV recordings, and overwhelming forensic evidence for this brutal bludgeoning not result in Zagreus Zagato’s murder conviction? The dismayed judge then noticed jurors nodding at Zagato’s rival, Vincent Mangino, grinning from the gallery. This isn’t the first time Mangino promised an expedient and proper execution.

We, the dead, the deceased unseen, are beyond legion.After life no paradise nor other place. Instead, this; a dark procession pacing Earth’s circumference, pet rats, rodents all, rotating a wheel, each trudging step spinning a world closer towards death.A sea of sons and daughters fathered by the cruellest God, our ghostly ocean toils, bringing each dawn, mocked by the warmth of his love radiating from the burning star that is his pulsing heartbeat.Tricked, we lean in, our walk becoming a run. For no fire burns forever.Ten billion years to go.So many souls still to come.

This game wasn’t fun anymore. I was seven and liked playing games like tic-tac-toe and go-fish.

Mom grabbed it and stuffed it into her apron pocket. I never saw her cry before.

Air Dancers

She ran her hands through the last petrified forests of hair on her balding scalp. More hair fell out, criss-crossing her fingers like mahogany cuts. A swallowed sob. A robin twittered outside. She pushed the screen door open. Bare feet slapped against the outdoor deck’s wet wood. A spring wind tugged at the hair in her fingers, making each strand flap like an air dancer in front of a used car lot. Then she let the strands float away, imagining the robin finding them and using the treasure to build a nest to shepherd new life into this world.

Why those images?She stood, turned, and younger than I expected, oddly attractive, youthful, neither sad nor happy. Forlorn.Walked away, trusting material possessions secure.Returned. Collected possessions, several backpacks, duffel bag, carry-on travel case, small travel bags…Trudged away. I wondered.

The Sacrifice

I listened in horror to their hate, their self-righteousness, their rationalisations. An echo-chamber of misguided self-concern.Until I could listen no longer.“If we accept people, without preconceptions or judgement, wouldn’t the world be a better place?”“But They are taking over.” One said.“You are too naive. Open your eyes.” Said another dismissively. “We can’t say anything these days without someone being offended.”Contempt in their eyes, they’d found their new target.They didn’t realise that I would happily take their bile if it saved even one other person from suffering from it.

The sofa is comfy, and my shoulders finally drop. I take a deep breath and start again.

Aware of their contributions, they lined up. Across the centuries—from the first glimmer of humankind’s interactions, through all the world’s evolving cultural, educational, arts, and scientific advancements—they lined up before Mother Time. Each one hoped to shine brightest. They were researchers, scientists, musicians, bishops, professors, writers of deep sensibility, and world-honored leaders. Humbly they waited, but soon saw their lights dimmed beside the child who, without thought of fame, gave his favorite marble to a classmate who felt shunned.

Lack of Compassion
<|story|>
At each of his blows, it screamed. But every time, he ignored its cry for mercy. Perhaps, his ears were incapable of hearing such painful yelps. He continued to strike devotedly. He would not want it to become something other than his choice. When he was done with hitting, he started with some other means of inflicting pain. Unmindful of its suffering and begging for pity, he went on. After many, many days, he rested his hands. Now, thousands throng everyday to view it with awe. Now, it proudly celebrates its maker’s passion as well as his lack of compassion.

Compassion in Crisis
<|story|>
Like a blunt knife, it's slowly cutting deep into my heart, twisting and turning with each beat. The memory, once sweet, is now tainted by the bitterness of deceit. Each time I try to forgive, the wound reopens, as if soaked in salt water. It has become a part of me, a tormentor that relentlessly preys on my mind, replaying and intensifying every scene with each passing day. Yet, hear me out, I don’t give up the fight, not wielding this blade against you, but for the sake of us.

Yesterday.You took your first steps with that broad smile on your face. No obstacle was hard enough, no matter the tottering pace of your chubby legs.

You got married, made me Grandma, and I’m bewildered at how time slipped away.Today.You are that empathy in your children’s eyes, an unabating reminder in their gleeful laughter, an added wrinkle on my face; precious memorabilia in our photo album.

Honey for the Bees
<|story|>
It was easy to feed them the lies they longed to hear. Offered on a silver spoon, coated in clover honey. How sweet the manipulation was. How organic. Inviting. It’s a shame so much that is consumed is camouflaged chemical. Devoured by our desire for sugar. If only the eyes could taste as well as the tongue. Maybe then, they’d be open wide enough to see. Wide enough to sense the sham. Taste the bitter truth that lay beneath.But, as long as there’s honey, they’ll go unnoticed. Leaving another drove of bees to swarm around their hive of lies.

Where the Bad Girls Go

Lou hadn’t been round this way before. Her mum had implied, no, had stated, that this was a place where only bad girls came. The colour hit her like Dorothy arriving in Oz: sparkles and flashing neon. And the noise assaulted her ears, yes, assaulted: insistent, burrowing deep without her permission. Cinema smells, too, turned up to eleven, the plastic scent of hot dogs, the sweetness of popcorn, the tang of something she didn’t want to classify. She felt her heart beat faster not knowing if it was panic, this was why she had been warned, or pleasure. ‘Mum?’

You can't hide from me. Don't try under the covers or your bed. I'm familiar with those places. The hallway isn't long enough for you to run away from me nor are you fast enough. That dark corner - too obvious. The closet-not there either.No, Lucy, you cannot always have your own way. Yes, you must obey. In life, there are codes of conduct and you are being taught to follow them. For now, to you I'm a mean old witch, but later on I hope you'll realize then that forever I've always been a loving mom.

Platero and I: Piano
<|story|>
Gordon's Choice In 1914, the Spanish poet Juan Ramón Jiménez published a prose poem entitled Platero y Yo. It comprises over 100 little stories about the gentle observations of an innocent rider talking to his donkey as he wanders around the rural Spain of the time.For many years, Hervé has been working on a project to extend Jiménez's work, some of which have turned up here. It's a sort of fan fiction. This is his latest.​ Sometimes on Sunday, Platero, I drink coffee on Mario's terrace. On Sunday afternoons, Carmen always visits her sick mother.Mario usually saves me a table with a nice view on Carmen's mother's house. Around three o'clock, Carmen takes a seat at the piano by the open window and plays preludes, études and nocturnes. Well-known pieces from unknown masters, unknown pieces from well-known masters, sometimes lasting over an hour. Every now and then, without talking to me to avoid breaking the magic, Mario brings me a coffee.​Carmen's mother is terminally ill, Platero, so the magic will be broken soon enough. As an afterthought, here's a Chopin Nocturne performed by one of our FFF contributors. (Honestly! Israela is seriously multi-talented – check out her CV.)

10-Second Time Machine
<|story|>
We did it! After decades of research, we finally made a time machine–a 10-second one to be exact. Now that might not sound much, but think of the implication! We have managed to break through the law of the universe, even by a mere second; that’s still damn impressive. And the best part is, I got to be the first to test it!Put my harness on, pull the switch here, push the big red button and…We did it! After decades of research, we--

The Accident

Our separation hit home.Our parents wouldn’t let us happen. Her teared eyes shut in my arms, as if bidding me adieu. She breathed her last moments later.People have an inherent folly. They tend to believe in theatrics over somber realities.A suicide's truth is greater than that of a broken heart.Therefore, I put you in this bath my dear. The sharp blade runs across your wrists but pierces my heart.There was no other way.At least you won’t feel the pain. Oh wait! Her eyes open!

Abandon Ship

His ship had a fatal, gaping hole on its port side below the waterline. Capt. Smiley knew that when a ship goes down, the rats leave first. Two of the rats – Rattus and Fred – reached the gunwale."My God. Sharks, Rattus."They hesitated as a dozen crew members gathered, then jumped overboard. The sea boiled. A horrified Smiley turned away from the feeding frenzy."What a bloody mess," cried Fred."Let's go. There's an island over there. I think we can make it.”"But the sharks, Rattus? They're awful.""No problem. C'mon.”"What?""Professional courtesy, Fred."

Adorned in Betrayal
<|story|>
My job is to sort the mail, filing it in the owner’s cubby. It was during my second week of employment that I recognized the CEO’s handwriting on a jewelry box. Peeking inside, I found a pair of jade earrings for the red-haired laughing receptionist. Those I deposited in her mail slot. Not my favorite gem. The next pieces, an opal brooch, and a diamond tennis bracelet, slipped into my apron pocket. I’ll keep them for a rainy day. He’s probably figured me out. I’ll be fired. I see the way my husband stares at my accessories over family dinner.

Flailing arms exposed a revolver even before he began foaming at the mouth.Whump! He hit the door running just as my father appeared."Dad, who was that?""I grew up with him.""Why was he here?""I do business with him.""Is he always that...strange?""Oh, you mean him foaming at the mouth.""Yeah.""Wait till you see him chew his tongue till the foam turns red."

Conversion
<|story|>
Wiping another stray tear, she feels the bony structure of her skull, her crooked nose always a surprise. How did she get so full of bones, so skeletal? She feeds the gulls. This is what she wants to become after. Soft and feathery. She doesn’t mind the hooked bills, the unintelligible clamor, the food stealing from empty promenades. “Oh, my gals”, her lips murmur softly, her palms cupped around the air, an image of herself as a young chick resurfacing in her watery eyes. The more she gives, the more they insist, smooth bald heads nearing her face, unwavering.

Two Red Umbrella’s
<|story|>
On a winter day, our red umbrellas danced a lambada between the bandstand, past the duckpond to the bus shelter. A Saul Leiter photograph of two anonymous lovers beneath twirling canopies, raindrops bouncing from them like pearls from a broken necklace. The stark colour against a dark backdrop. We caught our breath before realising the bus wouldn’t arrive and it gladdened us, for the dance resumed down the High Street, over the bridge, past bemused commuters. It was not what we did or where we were that mattered but how we alone saw and felt the dawn of entwined lives.

Reef and Rocks

Visibility is but a quarter mile, meanwhile the rain is pelting against the glass while a shortwave radio crackles in the background. From here a solo ray of light shouts, Beware!Three flashes and a pause. Repeat. Announcing, “here I am.”You squint neither seeing nor being seen, useless. Below waves crash the outcrop placed there by nature, caring not who may challenge them. The sound of bells warning travelers of danger, muffled by nature.Scattered along the coast, remnants remain. Other vessels having challenged rocks and reefs leaving behind stories.Pray if you want, nature does not care. Beware!

Oh, for the love of God.Try as I might to get a fire started, I have never succeeded. All those times kneeling at the hearth, downwind from my mother-in-law perched precariously on the armchair, as she watched me struggle with newspapers, kindling and logs, trying various layering techniques and leaning in beneath the chimney to blow furiously at any hint of flame.Always, finally, hauling myself up and going to get my stash of firelighters that I of course didn’t keep on show but used every single time.Who would have thought I could burn the fucking house down.

Compassion or Manipulation

When I got the text about how we were going to celebrate New Years Eve, I was delighted, until I saw that it was addressed to Kathy, my name is Anne. He denied that it meant anything other than commonplace concern for a lonely woman but I was lonely too. “Ok” I said “in that case take me to meet her”.To my amazement he agreed, my heart lifted and the world righted itself again. Then he added, “On condition that you agree to my every demand for the whole weekend”. The world tipped sidewards once more.“No way, goodbye”

The Message

Butterflies, honeybees, and other insects had left the plants reluctantly, leaving me alone on the bench in the garden. Images of me assisting my wife to look after the plants that bore colourful flowers recurred in my mind. Glasses of beer, a gentle breeze, and the moon peeping through clouds dragged me slowly to sleep. The smell of her perfume told me she, expected to arrive any time from a war-torn country with her parents, was nearby.The sound of the telephone jerked me awake. All three died in a bomb attack, I was informed.

Split Decision
<|story|>
A malignant mass in the brain. Numbness in the righthand extremities. Inability to read and diminished vision. Diagnostics ruled out surgery. But ongoing targeted radiation treatments slowed its growth even though the cancer invaded both hemispheres. The corpus callosum that connects the two brains was damaged. This resulted in his right hand literally not knowing what his left hand was doing and unfortunately led us into criminal court today.The verdict was unprecedented. The defendant’s ‘left hemisphere’ was found not guilty. Whereas his knife wielding ‘right hemisphere’ was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to no more radiation treatments.

Toby reached down from his skateboard with his braking glove, stopping at the auditorium. Inside, he changed into his performing gloves and waited nervously behind the curtain.Resting on his pelvic stump, he raised both arms to greet a shocked audience.The jazz music took hold of him. His tap-dancing gloves clicked against the wooden floor in perfect time with the music. His torso, the main portion of his body, bobbed to the rhythm until it appeared to float, suspended in the air, as he clapped his hands together before catching himself.The applause was deafening. They’d finally accepted him.

Balancing the Books
<|story|>
Chloe balanced the books she was carrying as though by doing so she could weigh their importance. The one in her left hand was leather-bound; the one in her right, a paperback. She didn't need to open them to know what was inside and she didn't need to look at the prices. She carried them to the counter where the bookseller was huddled into his hoodie, reading. He raised his head and opened his gap-toothed mouth in a silent laugh. 'You can pay cash for the paperback,' he said, 'But the other one will cost you your soul.'

Birthday

He kept the photo of his tenth birthday beside his bed. Every day, he would look at it, taking in the smiles and love that filled it. Smiles of his father. Of his mother.It had been a decade since the photograph was taken, and the space around the table wasn’t as full as it had once been. Wasn’t as joyous. As he stared down at the candles flickering atop his cake—the mark of another year—he sighed.Blowing them out, he wished it could have been how it was before.A room of love. Of smiles.Of them.

Inconceivable

It’s my first visit to a mikveh to help me conceive. I undergo a niddah here after I menstruate. Eve’s sin brought women shame. My period brings impurity. A mikveh is the womb of the divine. I wish to be reborn in a blinding flash of light and whirling hysteria. My fingertips melt into infinite light as I clasp the water of divinity. I feel the stirrings of a tiny child inside me. My body offers a haven of love. Someone splashes the water, and I sit childless inside the mikveh bath. My womb remains empty, my prayers unheard.

Didn’t she remember how we spent summer nights in the mazy meadows, evenings on the nude beaches and mornings on the hilltops? If only she'd told me how to delete the delectable data in our mind's computer or shed green leaves from our life's tree.

Opus Magnus

She wrote when pain kept her awake.Her aching knee won her a short story competition; her hip pain, a poetry challenge. The persistent shoulder ache spawned a series of children’s stories; the lumbar pain, a sequel currently at the publishers. The morphine had both minimised the pain and set her mind free. Soaring to new heights, she blended truth and fantasy, creativity and history in a heart-rending story, scribbling down the closing words with her final breath.It was a masterpiece. Sadly, the diligent carer binned the scrawled sheets along with other detritus while awaiting the undertaker.

Gordon's Choice The drone of the Avro Lancasters and the pummel of bombs that had raged all night, finally ceased. In lieu they left wrathful fires, crumbling buildings and a sense of finality. Exiting his hiding place, his hand brushed cold sticky blood, spread over armour like marmalade. The rising sun revealed four dead crocodiles, deposited on Budapesterstrasse like this was a normal Tuesday occurrence. He cradled the head of the nearest reptile, its impenetrable scales unassailable in its own territory but not here. His city was gone, normal would not be seen again in his lifetime. These were not crocodile tears.

Somewhere in the parking lot a car radio blared ‘Where Did Our Love Go?’ Years later he walked by me in the grocery store. I didn’t recognize him.

Toppled panels, sticking out rods and crumbled bricks, covered with dust and broken furniture... We keep digging right into the night, excavating someone’s ruined life like hidden history in blooded blankets, rolled up bodies of now forever sleeping kids.We cry a little, off the camera, then go home and look at our children like for the first time, or the last. We pray, we hope, it’s not about us, it’s someone’s bad luck, someone else’s grief. Then we see it, with a jolt, the Batman blanket on their beds. The silly pattern that is now all over the news.

The present’s imperfect: a dog too old to learn new tricks, too young to not retrain, that’s him. A boiled frog, curried good, his goose is cooked. Both daughters still in school, still needing dowries, what poor boys could he afford to buy them now? Christian, they’re still Indian, it’s tradition alive and kicking. But the buyer insists, persists: Tell us— What’s it worth? What’s your value?

Alter-ego

Tattoos of fire, you control fire, lizards, you can climb walls, and guys with tribal tattoos suddenly bonded together.I have a butterfly and a phoenix, I didn’t know which would dominate, I waited nervously. I’d forgotten all about the wolf print on my forearm. It was a bit of a surprise the first time I changed, but not as much as it shocked the butcher when I completely wolfed out and stole a leg of lamb!

Give

Let them stew in the fetid harbour of their prejudice. I say give if you’ve got it to spare.Come the morning I poach two eggs. Try to convince him that a spread of Marmite on his toast is good for the health. Iron in the soul and all that! He leaves with his few mumbled words, whatever goodness I have behind him.

With banshee-like howling, the wind whipped towering waves to batter the windows surrounding us. With all of our loved ones in attendance, it suddenly occurred to me to wonder how sturdy the glass was.I had thought it would be memorable to get married in a lighthouse on the coastline of Brittany, France. My husband-to-be had gamely gone along with this. We’d rolled the dice on the weather, since our chosen date, Valentine’s Day, coincided with the tempest season…Cupping his hand around an ear, the priest shouted, “Continue!”“For better or worse!” I yelled, to a chorus of laughter.

It wasn’t a good look.The laughter wasn’t a good sound.The one positive was the humans thought she was going to a fancy dress party.

I don’t like people.Large vicious creatures that lash out when I fly by.Mostly, I don’t fly by.I sit high on their kitchen walls.Watching.Often, not much goes on.People come. They go. They eat, read, cook, wash up.Sometimes they shout and wave arms at each other. Initially, it alarmed me but now I know there’s usually a resolution. Either there are tears and then everything is quiet again. Or the noise continues. Doors slam. Saucepans clash. Sighs, grunts and tuts.It’s remarkable what you learn about human behaviour when you’re a fly on the wall.

Church friends I had would be visiting me in this nursing home if they all hadn’t died. The only visitor I have is Pastor Ralph who comes every Sunday to preach after lunch in the dining room. He’s also the Elvis impersonator most Friday nights. He gets a free meal for the preaching and $75 for the singing. I don’t like watching his Elvis act, the way he shakes and struts around. Some of the women in the audience act pretty silly too. Maybe they’re remembering something from when they were young, or maybe they’re just having fun.

I pass that tree every day as I walk from the bus stop. Glancing round to check no one is near, I stroke its gnarled, rutted bark, peeping into the dark hollow that age has carved out. Sometimes crisp packets or sweet papers have blown in and I carefully clear them away. It makes me feel safe and useful, as if we are guardians of one another. But today, leaving the bus, I feel a shift in the air. I hear the chainsaw’s screech before I see it. I know where it has cut. A hollow opens in my heart.

Batman Blanket
<|story|>
Toppled panels, sticking out rods and crumbled bricks, covered with dust and broken furniture... We keep digging right into the night, excavating someone’s ruined life like hidden history in blooded blankets, rolled up bodies of now forever sleeping kids.We cry a little, off the camera, then go home and look at our children like for the first time, or the last. We pray, we hope, it’s not about us, it’s someone’s bad luck, someone else’s grief. Then we see it, with a jolt, the Batman blanket on their beds. The silly pattern that is now all over the news.

Broken Trust

Crystal turned to Robert. She said, "Don't ever touch me again!"His hand fell away."When you cheated, you lost me forever," she declared."You can't mean that. We've been together for years." She stared at him. "It was only one time; we can start over."She shook her head. "I can never trust you again. A relationship is like a fine porcelain cup. If it gets fractured, it can be repaired, but the crack will always be there. I'll always love you, Robert, but I'll forever see that girl, with you, in our bed."Without another word, Robert left.

She giggled. “Your mustache tickles.”My body stiffened. My mustache or his?

Painter's Block
<|story|>
Spring had danced her merry jig in all corners of the village; she’d splashed fresh green over hedgerows packed with the chatter of excited sparrows. I gathered my paints and easel, and sat beside that sweet scented hawthorn; the bluest of skies in the background.She’d daubed pink onto recently clothed trees. Drops of yellow and drips of white down by the stream that flowed easily now with winter’s ice becoming a distant memory.I sketched for hours in the warmth of the sun, but didn’t use my brushes once: my palette unable to compete with those on nature’s canvas.

Instead he bit his finger, as his mother used to do. Blood dripped onto the bathroom vanity.Jeanine's vapid niceness mocked his perpetual agony.He gathered himself, walked out of the room, and said, sweetly, "I'm good, babe. How about hot dogs and beans for supper?"He gripped the knife loosely.

He put down his phone, flushed the toilet and prepared for a job interview at the new high-tech company. The stark decor was slightly intimidating as was the receptionist who ordered him to stand until summoned. A sinister looking woman in black suit strode up and gave him the once-over. She shook his hand with vigor. "We will not be needing you. Your CV, blue eyes and blond hair are exceptional, but we want people with a natural killer instinct. Judging from your morning Solitaire games, you chronically surrender too soon. Goodbye." "Wait, what?" She smiled. "Tomorrow belongs to me."

Forever

“How long will it hurt?”The reflection in the glass was silent, but sorrowful. It looked him over pensively, before responding.“Maybe forever. But that’s the risk you were willing to take, wasn’t it?”He tensed, watching as his image in the mirror did the same. “Don’t we all?”His eyes met the reflection’s, gazing into them. Glazed over in fresh tears. One fell, landing hard against the white porcelain sink. “There was life before her. And life with her. I never thought there would be life after her...”And that, he knew, was what was going to hurt forever.

The Answering Machine
<|story|>
When Mama died, I stole our answering machine. At ten years old, I’d play the greeting over and over again, push play, rewind, play and rewind to hear her voice, the voice that was like the light inside of a full, milk moon. My Daddy, he didn’t get mad about me stealing. I don’t think he wanted to deal with the outpouring of messages about Mama’s depression, all that gloomy stuff. Still, when I’d play the recording for the neighborhood kids, I made sure to tell them my Mama was fierce. And now, she belonged to the sky.

Directly opposite, a car was parked, headlights off, and only the glow of a cigarette revealed the presence of a passenger. Stepping away from the window, he tucked the stolen documents beneath his coat and took out a cigarette of his own. He lit a match, dropped it onto the carpet and watched the flame grow. 'Fire! Fire!' he yelled, running into the corridor and waited until there was a proper state of panic before mingling with the fleeing crowd.

The Fifth Wave of Feminism
<|story|>
My placard reads: MOTHERHOOD SMOTHERS WOMEN. I join the marching throng. Furious females with children line our route, shouting abuse, sometimes kicking at us. A mile in, a rush of nausea hits me, closely followed by that familiar dull ache flowing across my abdomen. I drop my pace till it ebbs a little, but it quickly returns and I'm overcome again. This time, dropping out of step completely to collapse against a wall. A breastfeeding mother approaches: "You OK?" I grimace, wiped-out. She rummages in a handbag, hands me two paracetamol, spits on my placard and returns to the line.​

The bearded men with stentorian voices demand our obedience with endless proclamations, new initiatives, walls of words I no longer believe. There’s only the pretense of equity and lavish nonsense.I need your support and have cc’d no one, but this will be the email HR references when they fire me.

Sharing a bumpy life with me, we had sons and daughters. Our insurance of a care-free future, we thought.When their wings grew strong, they flew away to greener pastures.

Young Again

I’m not 81 years old. I’m 11 years and six months. How would you like it if I said you’re seven years old? Actually, I said, that makes me feel young again.

That, you call THAT graffiti. Uninspired. Lazy. I wrote all over this town. I was all city. Everyone knew me. None better than town officials who got tired of buffing.

Us

Devasted and heartbroken, Chris paused at Dana's photo and reflected upon the love they shared. Sentimental words were often spoken...We never gave the subtle changes that occurred a second thought.

Under one roof we were two people still being intimate with each other while ignoring moments of indiscretion.The neighbors gossiped. To them our loving relationship was bizarre. It was always misunderstood. So what if it was...it worked for us.

I bored a little hole just below my knee, where it grinds and crunches at the slightest bend. I eased in the delicate nozzle, then squeezed slowly, feeling the thin oil penetrate, sluice the dried bones, plump the desiccated ligaments, coat the flaccid muscles. I did the other one too, then tested them, swinging gently. There was no pain, no tautness, no ligamentous argument, no tendon screaming. Oiled, clean, smooth-running, agile and manoeuvrable, I sprinted up the hill.

Then when I stand and say I’m done he tells me to push. That nothing good comes easy. I sit – this time on the low bench by his feet. I sweat. I breathe.

AI Happiness: YA Interpreted
<|story|>
Rhonda was curious. “Did your niece get the free AI vaccination?”“She’s so addicted to social media she practically had to,” responded Dena.“What’s that have to do with it?”“She made the decision after her two besties’ suicides. My niece became convinced that AI endorphin nanocytes would protect her. Now she follows the juiciest negative threads online without any self-harm risk. She’s permanently happy.”Dena continued. “Providing such a good example, all her friends have been vaccinated. They can be as mean on social media as they want and are never affected. It’s simply another way AI saves lives.”

The Changing Skyline of Los
<|story|>
We drown in the details—what to wear to church, where to meet for coffee. “There’s a Starbucks on the corner where we used to sell lemonade,” you remind me, and I picture our homemade sign coming apart in some attic.“You know another crew came in last week.” I nod. “More ruins to sift through.” What for? What is the precious thing we lose when the future rolls into town on a bulldozer? We would never been tempted to follow the crew out again if we’d known how much the map had changed, and how little we understood detours.

A Song for the Spring
<|story|>
She found peace in the night, beneath the silver moon—watching as its light bathed the fading snow. In the shadows, the land glistened and glowed, welcoming the silence. The steady steps towards spring.And she’d sit beside her window, listening for the wolves. Longing for their howls. Their chilled breath carrying midnight songs on the wind. Serenading a farewell to a long and bitter winter. A beckoning for better days. Better hunts.The frost had claimed not only a part of the earth, but a part of her, as well.Now, like them, she longfully sang for the spring.

JFK and Me
<|story|>
In June 1963 the schoolmaster marched us to the Rising Tide. We were herded into the pub. John-Joe, the owner tried to manage us. I got to sit on a sticky shelf halfway up a Guinness-stained wall.​ They had an utterly fascinating television which we were excited to watch, not realising that the ticker tape parade in Dublin was an historical event, or that I was witnessing what the US president described as ‘the best four days of my life’. In November everybody in Ireland would forever remember what she was up to when the president was shot in Dallas.

Flowers
<|story|>
I’d hear the slow thunk and whoosh of a walker approaching my office hoping it was her. The big white sneakers and plaid polyester pants accentuated her tiny body. She’d peak around the corner chuckling, “Is the Administrator available?” “She quit,” I’d respond.I visited her room as often as I could. She sat on the bed offering me the only chair. Once I brought her flowers from my garden. She wrote me a thank you note I kept for years after the space was no longer a sanctuary.

Her voice took flight, gliding over notes like a bird skimming a lake, dipping and rising until she came to rest on the final note and held it for the full four beats, slowly spreading circles in the water.Her heart soared as she waited. Surely this time she had succeeded.The Professor of Music sighed, his eyes downcast.‘It just won’t do. Months of work and still you miss the dotted crotchets in bar six. Practice, practice, practice.’He rose from his chair. She listened for the key turning in the lock.

Mind Readers
<|story|>
They tricked me into it. I thought it was a brain implant to eliminate insomnia – instead, it allowed others to read my mind.Going out in public became cringeworthy: husbands wanted to punch me for my thoughts about their wives; other men became offended by my thinking they were ignorant; women left dinner dates as my monkey mind plotted post-meal seduction strategy.I finally got a meeting with the lead scientist.“Nope. Can’t do that,” he said before the words even left my mouth.Next, a squad of goons entered the room. They took thoughts of murder seriously.

Eulogy Cake
<|story|>
Spatula poised. She began to tell her story with an empty bowl as her blank page. Flour as white as her mother’s face became the background. No butter, only glistening oil that cast prisms as it poured. Plump eggs, their round perfection like the continuum of life, would bind the sweet raisins of memories and the salty tears of regret. Shoshona beat the mixture, coaxing life into the inert batter. Once baked, each bite had to extol her beloved mother’s story into the mourner’s mouth.

The Conversationists

When the Grump sat next to John he was huffing and puffing with an air of stale odour, waving his Daily Mail as he settled downSomehow they started chatting and John felt the urge to prick the Grump’s strident views on life in general and football in particular with little humorous sideswipes. At first the old man took them in his stride but he became exasperated.“I’ll tell you what you are,” he blurted through his matted beard. “ You…You……There’s a word for you if only I could think of it.”Many have tried to find that word.

We were opposites--city girl--country boy; East Coast--midwest; apartment–farm. His eyes were cornflower blue. We sparked each other. I wrote poems, he made music. My friends didn’t like him.He gave me Barlett’s Quotations. I bought him a blue sweater at Saks. I pictured us living in middle America with lots of babies. One day, driving in pouring rain, he sighed, “You’ll never leave Boston. You’re happy here.” I protested but two days later, he was gone.I found his sweater scrunched up on the closet floor. I wished he’d taken it. That sweater made his eyes such a bright blue.

I’m entranced. Me and Molly both.“He’s beautiful, Molly,” I say, kissing her. “What shall we name him?”“Alexander? Your father’s name?”“No,” I say, stifling tears. “Not Alexander. Too soon.”A nurse knocks. “Oh my,” she says. “Those eyes! What an angel. What’s his name?”“Gabriel?” Molly asks. “Like the archangel?”I nod, stifling tears.“Gabriel,” Molly says emphatically. “Gabriel, Alexander.”I smile, letting tears flow.

Barry Takes a Trip
<|story|>
Barry didn’t believe in aliens, flying saucers and abductions, so he was dumfounded when a silvery craft beamed him aboard to meet its humanoid occupants.They spoke his language, albeit oddly accented, and explained they were taking him through hyperspace to another planet, where he would meet with other abductees.Soon the spaceship landed near what looked rather like an Earth township. Bored-looking people, some munching burgers and sipping from cans, wandered about behind a tall wire fence.‘What does that say?’ said Barry, pointing to a sign in alien script.‘Planet Zoo. Earth Exhibit. Keep Out.’

Dorothy glanced sideways. She admired the evenly-spaced snowdrops bordering her neighbour’s front lawn. Resigned, she hauled herself up and retreated to the kitchen for a cuppa.An hour later, Dorothy ventured outside to find an array of snowdrops under her bay window.“They come up so quickly!” her neighbour trilled, hoping Dorothy wouldn’t notice the hastily dug holes, the transfer of plants. Dorothy smiled. “How odd. I’d planted aconites.”

“A few more things to do,” he mumbled into his cellphone.Normally he’d build himself a dinner sandwich with whatever the fridge provided. For today, he borrowed library cookbooks to create dishes he’d never heard of.“Picking you up soon, Mabel,” he phoned again, tasting a sauce, unaware of his dog standing by the back door.When they stepped outdoors, his heart sank like the celery soufflé out of the oven.He phoned. No answer. With his car buried and his path to it not close to being cleared, he realized he had a long snow-shovelling date with a Nor’easter.

The only tale the ship told was burn marks on its once glinting hull.More than one hundred ships blasted off, each carrying the dying hope of humanity who struggled to breathe through thick mask in the chemical soup that was once called air.“Is it over?” Zake blurted out his rotting breath.Christina answered. “Not yet. There is one more ship.”Zake, however, knew there were no more.

The White Dress

He calls her for the 17th time. The phone rings-rings-rings. She sits by the window, tears roll down her cheeks as she looks outside, a little girl is playing, laughing. She’s laughing. Yesterday, her world was shiny. Today, she severed ties with two bridesmaids, her fiancé, snap, like that. They knew. Every damn one of them knew. He was cheating with one friend, but they covered it up like fresh dirt over a grave. She’s glad she spotted them kissing in another window on Main Street, that evening she shopped for the white dress that would float in the wind.

Blood and Bone

He saw her in the midnight hour, in the darkness stirring at the foot of his bed. He saw her in visions, haunting both his slumber and wake. And he saw her in the mirror, each morning while he stared. Picking apart his features. Wearing them down to bone.Blood.He’d weep over the sink, in relief and in grief. That she was both forever there, but forever gone. A truth too painful to bear.But he knew she still lived, even if they would never touch. She lived in the glass. In the marrow. In the veins.In him.

Blossom Tree
<|story|>
Lisa's Choice A faint chirp was heard at the top of the tree. Following the gentle wind rustling sound of dry leaves. It's dying. It's dead, Mr. Henry grieved. I will never forget her beautiful smile. I remember that day, Cherry Blossom! Surprised at the sachet of seed I gave her, she loved it, of course, wishing for it to grow. As time goes by, it sprouts and grows until it becomes a tree. But why? Mr. Henry swings the axe and strikes at the dead tree. The birds fly. It felt without leaves, without branches, without you, but still lives in my heart. Lisa added that there's an (early) February Blossom Festival in Japan – only 3 hours from Tokyo, if you're passing. But the photos look lovely.     (Photo: Minamiizu Town Tourism Association)

Tachypsychia

Flying. I was flying. Floating in the air leisurely, effortlessly. It seemed to stretch out far longer than half a second. I had plenty of time to look behind me and see my bicycle rolling along by itself, still upright, even though no one was in the saddle. I had time to think about hitting the pavement. I predicted the impact would be harsh, but it seemed a long way off. I wondered whether I be crippled. My helmet cracked on the ground, ending the lazy flight. Time resumed its normal pace. I learned a new word that day.

“Did you get the new AI vaccination?” Rhonda asked her friend.“Months ago,” Dena responded. “The AI nanocytes really work. I feel great.”“Well, there’s something I don’t understand. ‘Pursuit of happiness’ has been stricken from the Constitution.”“There’s an easy explanation,” Dena replied. “Happiness now exists for everyone. It's like gravity or oxygen- they aren’t in the Constitution either. With the availability of the vaccine, AI generated endorphins have taken care of that."“Yes,” Rhonda returned. “However, I thought the original Constitution was never supposed to be changed."“Why should you care? Why should anyone care?” Dena laughed happily.

Winter

Polly was giddy; the first snowstorm was coming. She splurged on better wine and frosted coconut scones. On her counter, she lined up the ingredients to make chili and cornbread in the morning. She hauled firewood and downloaded a mystery. What timing: her husband was away on business, so the house was all hers. She fell asleep dreaming of tomorrow’s winter wonderland. But when she opened the blinds, she slumped. Unlike Polly, newscasters celebrated the storm’s miss. She carried on with her plans anyway, but without a snowfall, the day lacked the magic she craved.

Just watch it unfold and hope we would survive. And I know she blames me, I can tell. The silence, the looks, staying out later.Still I love her – despite her feline reactions.

Perhaps some rigorous study,” he laughed.That remark strengthened his conviction even more.He worked with determination and became what would eventually elevate him to the nobility, specifically the first professional pedestrian.

Dad's Silver Pocketwatch
<|story|>
We think my dad’s old, silver pocket watch stopped at the same time as his heart. It was as though it knew he was about to go. At bedtime, he’d left it bedside lined up with cuff links, fountain pen, tie-pin and fedora as though ready to auction his worldly belongings. It was engraved on the back as a retirement gift for forty years of service to the NHS. It never worked again. We thought about getting it repaired, thinking it was time for us to move on, but forgot that you leave so much behind when moving forward.

I needed to go badly. The blue sign said the rest area was in five miles, thirty-five until another.

I squirmed uncomfortably while Jared drove just below the speed limit. When I emerged from the restroom, Jared said he knew I could do it and handed me a huge coffee. We kissed. Today, I wonder how I’d missed Jared’s mind games. But I suppose nobody expects such behavior to begin on their honeymoon.

Slowly, I would grow taller and perhaps as strong as the earth’s crust. Then, wild life lovers would throng to look at me for amusement. A lone leafy life amidst big barren rocks!

But it would be better not to mention this.

But I wondered when he would become unaware that he was aware. In time he became quiet. No more wonderful stories, no funny jokes, or clever comebacks. That’s when I knew my beautiful brother was off chasing memories of stories that I knew so well, I began to repeat them.

"Who are you always texting?""For the hundredth time, no one."He pounded his fist on the counter. "Dammit, Kelly, I'm not stupid. I know there's someone else."She shook her head, did her best to dam the tears. Yes, she had a secret life, but it wasn't what Scott suspected. But if she told him the truth, he wouldn't believe her and, even if he did, he'd find a way to ruin her writing career, too."Don't worry, you don't know him." Sadly, it was easier to go along with who he thought she was rather than be herself.

Spinning
<|story|>
Her head jerked up and towards the front entrance. She thought she’d heard footsteps.Nothing. The door remained shut. Three hours had passed with no word.Turning back to the stove, she checked the flame and continued to stir. The mushroom-and-onion aroma helped calm her. Still, the olive oil crackled, stinging when it jumped.The bells finally jangled, and she resisted the impulse to look this time, afraid of that moment of knowing. She heard him stamp snow off his boots.“She’s OK,” he said, his voice thick.Spinning, she saw the dog in his arms, shivering, ice-caked, but alive.

I never got to enjoy life...not one little breath of it.Now as you're drawing your last breath, perhaps you'll think of me.

Weather Warning

“Great weather,” the old man says to me in the café.I assume he’s being sarcastic – the rain’s lashing down outside. But no, he means it.“It’s 2nd February, Candlemas,” he says. “If Candlemas brings cloud and rain, winter won’t come again. It’s an old saying.”I tell him that I don’t believe in old sayings.Next day, the weather’s even worse. When I visit the café again for my morning espresso, the old man’s there again.“What happened to your Candlemas theory?” I ask him.“I told you,” he insists, “this is the start of a typically bad summer.”

Short-Sighted

They finally did it. After years of bickering, they agreed on a deal to reduce the surge of migrants at the border.It was a political compromise that nobody really liked. Conservatives thought it was too permissive. Liberals thought it was too harsh. Migrants, exhausted and dispirited, gave up.All the while, the country's birth rate kept declining and its population kept aging, even as its workforce kept shrinking and its job market kept growing.Feeling the pinch, the country decided to reverse course and relax its immigration policy. But those known as aliens were now wary and stayed put.

Waiting
<|story|>
Through days and nights, good ones and bad, we wait and put off until later whatever life decisions brooding on our minds. Find a better job? Move to a bigger house? Get an education? Victory first. We must hold our breaths, clench our teeth, focus on one goal, and wait. Pending.War gives no guarantees. Even if it seems safe, you still put life on pause, save your energy and stand on guard, pending.Then I see my grandma’s white face in the bathtub, and my heart pends for one terrible second. I guess her death could wait no longer.

Dead Reckoning
<|story|>
I sailed on the Firth of Forth steering toward the river Fife. My soul needed to be where the frith of calm waters settled me. I sailed forth to the North, in clothes of woolly warmth. I reefed the sails in the wind and drifted hither to yon until the darkening sky warned me of a coming storm.Hoisting sail, I turned the rudder and tacked starboard. While the sea wrought its wrath, I battled. The dingy tossed and thrashed as I pledged troth to Poseidon in hope of salvation.Denied, I cursed his adamantine trident from my watery grave.         Editor's Note: There really is a "Firth of Forth" – I live in Edinburgh, on its shore, and on the other side of the Forth lies the county of Fife. There's also a famous old Scots ballad called Sir Patrick Spens, collected around 200 years ago but telling a story dating back to around 1500.There's a song version of it, too. Here's its most famous rendering, from the legendary English folk-rock band Fairport Convention, c.1970.                  SIR PATRICK SPENSThe king sits in Dunfermline tounedrinking the blude reid wine,"O whar can I get skeely skipper,To sail this ship o' mine?"Up and spak an eldern knicht,Sat at the kings richt kne:"Sir Patrick Spens is the best sailorThat sails upon the se."The king has written a braid letter,And signed it wi his hand,And sent it to Sir Patrick Spens,Was walking on the strand.To Noroway! to Noroway!to Noroway oer the faem!The king's daughter to Noroway'Tis thou maun bring her hame.The first line that Sir Patrick red,A loud lauch lauched he;The next line that Sir Patrick red,A teir blinded his ee."O wha is this has don this deid,This ill deid don to me,To send me out this time o' yeir,To sail upon the se!   ​"Mak haste, mak haste, my mirry men,Our guid ship sails the morne":"O say na sae, my master deir,I feir a deadlie storme."Yestreen I saw the new moone,Wi the auld moone in her arme,And I feir, I feir, my master deir,That we will cum to harme."O loth, o loth,The Scots lords wereTo weet their cork-heild schoone;Bot lang owre a' the play wer playd,Thair hats they swam aboone.O lang, lang may the ladies sit,Wi' their fans into their handOr ere they see Sir Patrick SpensCome sailing to the strand.O lang, lang may the ladies stand,Wi thair gold kems in their hair,Waiting for thair ain deir lords,For they'll se thame na mair.Haf owre, haf owre to Aberdour,Tis fiftie fathom deip,And thair lies guid Sir Patrick Spens,The Scots lords at his feit

The Deadly Retreat
<|story|>
The warnings came just after the sea retreated. The wet sheet of sand was naked for half a mile. Colorful shells glistened like enticing jewels. Lured by the sudden exotic resplendence, they ran barefoot. They paid no heed. Even when I hollered about the foamy dark curls at a distance. I ran when I saw it coming. My lungs felt on fire. The wall of salty water came with an unrelenting fury. Preyed upon the souls that trusted it. Drowned the echoes of my screams with a loud hiss. Corpses floated like logs while the black wave continued to surge.

Hiking the Langtang

(Image: “Langtang” by Tobias Federle on Unsplash.)  One of the Tamangs we hired to guide us on the Langtang Trek spoke English quite eloquently. From the trailhead at Suyabru Besi to the top at Kyanjin Ri he did all the talking, while the others carried the baggages. When we parted company he told us, “the great sublime idol holds sway over you until the menacing murmur from the netherworld frightens you to your senses.” Then he added a few words in his native language. At the hotel the concierge was reluctant to translate it verbatim, only remarked the guide must have been very disappointed with the tip.

I still live here.” “I’m here to demolish it.” I bolted but her attack was swift. Now, I live here too.

A Charmless Affair

I was expecting him. A dissatisfied client from my after hours job as medium, clairvoyant and sorcerer. I sent the barista home and waited in the empty saloon until Mr Resentment himself stormed in at sunset, tossed the talisman on the counter and drew his revolver in a single movement.'It doesn't work, Witch,' he snarled and pulled the trigger. I ducked, the bullet ricocheted off the coffee machine, the jukebox and the chandelier, and I saw him drop dead in a mess of glass and gore. 'Yes it does,' I said, picking up the amulet and leaving the locale.

At his funeral, everyone took me aside, and said, “she’s not as bad as he said.” What I didn’t know, until she entered my life, is that she was.

My mother was vegetable bargaining, again, making me think I had a choice. “You have a choice,” she insisted. That night, I could enjoy either mushy, yellow-green broccoli spears or slimy, sauteed mushrooms. I told her neither. “Neither is a choice,” I said. Apparently, not at her table. So, my mother served me healthy portions of both broccoli and mushrooms. I read the candidate list again, but I still couldn’t decide.

The worst was not when he was fathoms below, among the colourless monstrosities of the deepsea’s evernight. Yes, the water crushed his spine, but he soon grew numb to the pain, hobnobbing with habitual bottomfeeders.The worst was when he found himself drifting upwards, sighted fellow creatures in the sunflecked waters, and, breaking through the surface, gasping cold air, glimpsed the jewel-blue sky. Terrible was life’s beauty, terrible his sin in having deserted it.He’d peer back into the murk, thinking how easy it would be to sink again, to defer yet another day the moment of rising, birth, agony.

A beautiful artist’s rendering — the Vajolet Towers in the background. I laugh. “Italy At Work,” with a German woodcutter.

“I won’t come back next year!” she screamed. The headmistress left her bedside, and all day, others who passed her room peeked in warily and scurried down the hallway. She’d tried to discuss her feelings about boarding school with her parents this morning. Mama turned away silently to fold an armful of sun-dried sheets while Daddy fled to the porch to smoke his pipe. Their farm was freedom from this cruel monotony of rules and institutionalized confinement. Now, a middle-aged woman, uninvited, appears. She kisses her cheek, whispers, “You don’t have to stay here if you don’t want to, Mom.”

Dining Room with Easy Access to the Well-Lit Kitchen
<|story|>
“This is it?”“Well, I did say it needed some TLC”“But only from the electrician, plumber, carpenter, builder, decorator, roofer and local planning officer…”“It’s already partly refurbished.”“You mean it used to look worse?”“There are some original features”“Well, a tree growing through the living room is certainly original. I prefer a pot plant. I imagine any original features have been stolen.”“Well, it is deceptively spacious. It is an excellent opportunity, offering superb value and is attractively priced.”“Speak the truth man”“For pity's sake, help us out. This thing's been on our books for years.”

Star Light, Star Bright
<|story|>
She stared up at the multitude of stars. Set in stark reality, they did not resemble the familiar tiny, twinkling diamond lights dotted against black velvet, but terrifying celestial orbs floating within the infinite darkness. It is amazing how much one could see without the fragile, protective layers of air cocooning us against the vast void beyond it. Breath-taking. In a literal sense. As the deafening screaming around her eventually shushed into a collective whimper, then a dreadful silence; she continued to stare at the stars until they claimed her last breath.

Until There were None

“Another one?” Keith smiled, receiving a piece of paper. He doubted anyone was as methodical as his wife Grace. She perfected lists of scribbled items with instructions, sometimes sketches. Reminders were posted on the fridge for their teens. Husband’s were taped on the TV remote control. Despite her diligence, mishaps occasionally happened with lists accidentally left home.Whether recipients appreciated her approach, or not, no one deduced that beneath her organizational persona was a woman ravaged by stress. Shock spread as news broke of her stroke at the age of fifty-two. Without lists to guide him, Keith lost his way.

Snowdrift
<|story|>
Gordon's Choice Frothy, fat flakes fell from the frosty sky. I slowly shovelled the steps, being mindful to take my time with the chore because of the cold air. The snow muffled the world around me, cozy and comforting.It had been a difficult week with doctors' appointments and stressful tests. I would have to make decisions about treatment and how I would manage my recovery time.I walked into the yard, into the foot-deep snow. I sat down, then lay flat in the comforting softness. I closed my eyes, feeling the cool splats of flakes on my cheeks, drifting, drifting, drifting.

End Times
<|story|>
During that same day a unique global event occurred: they all died. It was similar to Bubonic plague or Covid-19, however, only world leaders had been infected. Wars ceased, missile threats disappeared, and terrorism vanished. Reporting agencies were bereft of news so classical music filled the airwaves. Borders were left unguarded; people remained at home. Everyone prayed, hoped, and wondered. What would happen next? When nothing did, a peaceful calm entered hearts and minds. Residents eventually came out of their houses. Neighbors spoke quietly clustered in small groups. After a time, humanity continued about its business and problems realized solutions.

Morning Words
<|story|>
I sit down at my desk to write, hoping for inspiration, the sun streaming in through the window, nearly blinding me until I adjust the shades. My coffee mug sits, steaming, to the right of my laptop. It feels like a random day of pulling words out of the ether, sliding them into yesterday’s essay, until a movement catches my eye: a raccoon perched on the outside window ledge, peering in. Fat body, a broad striped tail, a robber’s mask on his face. I stare. He stares. He does not turn away. It’s obvious he’s come to steal my words.

San Francisco Sidewalk

Her smell hits me before I turn the corner. Sitting on the sidewalk, she stares at a stuffed plastic bag between her legs. Taking a half empty shampoo bottle from the bag, she tosses it aside while caressing her matted streaked blonde hair. Every strand a fading testament to better days. She reaches deeper inside the bag and slowly pulls out a lacy hot pink bra. Her mouth opens wide. With a dreamy look, she slowly swings the bra from her fingertips. It makes me want to scream “keep it!” but I don’t. That would require some kind of hope.

Macrescence
<|story|>
(Photo credit: author)    I headed back to the barn after a snowy walk through the blue-black hemlocks and was spooked by a sound breaking the quiet. Shoosh, shoosh, shoosh. A cross-country skier glided by on the adjoining trail. We waved our arms, and I shouted hello, but he kept on. As I stepped out of the trees and turned west, pumpkin-colored leaves drew my eyes back to the forest: a few curled beech blades, so translucent I might read a love letter through them. Somehow the low winter sun had penetrated the dark and found them, and passing through them, had found me.

Boring
<|story|>
Another air raid, another house bombed, more photos of the burning flats, bodies carried from under the ruins, screaming headliners, hating posts… She scrolls the news with a deadpan, slightly bored. It gets tiresome to stay shocked all the time, and she’s fed up with being scared for her future. Sometimes, she forgets it’s a war in her country. Bills have to be paid, dinner cooked, job done. Unless something more boring comes up. Like her brother asking for help with his house redecoration. “Well, I don’t think it’s a good idea, Lev.” She sighs woefully. “You know, this war…”

The Poetry Competition
<|story|>
It was truly a piece of literary genius. The expert judge commented on the perfect placing of enjambment and caesura within the iambic pentameter; the clever use of pyrrhic and trochaic substitutions to subtly move emphasis; the proper respect paid to grammar, punctuation and capitalisation. The layman judge knew nothing of these things. He chose a different poem, one which was loosely laid out like fragments of a dream scattered gently on to a sheet of paper. It spoke to his heart; tugged at his emotions; made him cry.Only one poem could win – but which one?

It's getting late for office and my right shoe is missing. I place the left shoe by the shoe rack and start looking. Under the cot, inside the cupboard, behind the curtains, inside the refrigerator, everywhere. Where's my right shoe?Ah! There it is. By the shoe rack inside the mirror. I lean forward and using a pole with a hook at the end (used for plucking mangoes), I carefully lift it and pull it out of the mirror. Let's get going. Oh, but where's my left shoe?!Ah! There it is. By the shoe rack inside the mirror...

For how can you escape someone till you’ve beaten them? Finally I was free to stride away.Shivering she lay, bleached and shrunken after her knee-replacement surgery. Soon she’d be awake and warmed with soup. Now I could desert her, as, time after time, she’d deserted me.But I had a choice. I clasped Ma’s hands, massaged them, weeping, with resentment, mostly. For to have a choice how to behave is to have no choice at all.

And there was a card from John saying he was annoyed I’d gone on holiday without him so he’s now dating someone else. Other than that, everything’s fine. I might pop to the travel agents after this appointment and book my next holiday.”

"This is my favorite part of the fair." Jackie inhaled deeply as she passed the food vendors. "That funnel cake sure smells good, but so do these sausages." She stopped at a concessions tent and pointed to the menu. "What are you in the mood for?" Shelley noticed the luscious hunk of a man spinning cotton candy in the next stand over, threads of pink sugar encapsulating him like prey in a spider's web. "I was thinking of chicken on a stick." He glanced her way, nodded and winked. She grinned. "But suddenly I've got a hankering for something sweet."

When she sees me, she smiles and intends to say, "Thank you," I think–but instead says, "You came all this way to give me this? That was dumb." I sit beside her. She glances toward the window and muses, "I like to listen for the Amish horses and buggies passing by." We wait together. In a while, we might play dominoes or gin. I will watch her oxygen levels and listen for the sound of hooves.

Not Yet

When she crossed the street and unlocked the gate and stepped into the yard and crouched behind the fountain, she did not want to pull the trigger; when she pulled the trigger she would hear unmistakably the whizzing of the bullet trough the cold air, the crack-thump when it reached the flesh, the murmur of love words she must forget, the squeaks of the new bed chosen among giggles, a bed she now hates, and she would see, once more, and in painful details, and rather surprisingly, the naked, bunched muscles of his back moving passionately over another woman.

Her Preference

After weeks of roller-coaster rain, fluctuating between drizzle and deluge, with mist filling brief respites, the sun appeared, striking Aubrey like a silent sledgehammer as she ran her daily course through the woods -- a route she'd long ago memorized, every twist and incline of the now-muddy trail, every jutting branch and fallen trunk, every root that poked from the ground, hoping to trip her -- and she realized in that instant that she preferred the gray of clouds and the bite of cold, for the sun's illumination brought clarity, a sharpness, a focus: the very thing she was trying to escape.

We have to trust that the risk of loving is always worth taking." He spoke.He’d read her rather than listen, looked inside of her, saw with his own eyes the pain and conflict she felt and put into words everything she could not express.

The Hermit
<|story|>
The hermit in the mountain cave heard a whop whop noise of propellers.A middle-aged man walked in and sat down cross legged. He wore a sheepskin pilot’s jacket with embroidered lettering on the lapel.“Derek,” spoke the hermit. “Why did you come?”“I have been searching for you,” the pilot replied. “This steep climb to the summit was not for me, so I thought I would take a short cut.”“What do you want?” inquired the wise man. “My question is: what is the meaning of life?”The answer to your question is simple: there are no short cuts.”

We All Have a Dragon
<|story|>
We all have a dragon. They are big enough to be slightly terrifying, but of a size that you can give them a good scratch behind the ears. The dragons are here because of the wishing well. When the well first appeared, there was a lot of wishing for gold, stalwart stallions, dry cottages, and good harvests. Once everyone had the basics, there was wishing for more exotic things. And once Tiller St. James had his dragon, everyone wanted one. Da tried to wish Ma back, but as we all sadly discovered, you can’t wish for people.

The Desertion of Sergeant Jim
<|story|>
The poppy field was like a scarlet sea and, as Jim strode through them, their petals stuck to his uniform so their heads reared, exposed and ugly, to the pewter sky. He tore off his jacket as he went, and dropped his rifle somewhere along the way. He saw his wife running towards him, arms outstretched, and soon she was leaning against his chest, her tears warm as they soaked his shirt. But when he bowed his head to kiss her, she'd disappeared and blood was blossoming like a rose in the place where his war torn heart had been.

The Legacy
<|story|>
It was a well-kept secret that I was about to be declared bankrupt.My aged father liked to sit alone in the lobby. When not writing, he would sit watching flocks of birds flying in the distance. Or the clouds moving across the sky, changing their shapes frequently. Or a tiny-looking aircraft making its way through clouds, leaving a trail of smoke after it disappeared.Days after his sudden death, I opened his room. Inside the table was a publisher's letter offering an astronomical sum for a novel. The note from my father said: "Congratulations on your new novel."

Her Preference
<|story|>
After weeks of roller-coaster rain, fluctuating between drizzle and deluge, with mist filling brief respites, the sun appeared, striking Aubrey like a silent sledgehammer as she ran her daily course through the woods -- a route she'd long ago memorized, every twist and incline of the now-muddy trail, every jutting branch and fallen trunk, every root that poked from the ground, hoping to trip her -- and she realized in that instant that she preferred the gray of clouds and the bite of cold, for the sun's illumination brought clarity, a sharpness, a focus: the very thing she was trying to escape.

Great Blue Herons

A pair of great herons made a nest on the top of a tall spruce next to my house. Each day, I spent many hours behind a camouflage netting, taking countless photos with a camera with long-range telephoto lenses.When summer’s long days began waning, I found the nest to be empty. I never found out why the parents abandoned the nest before the chicks fully fledged. Maybe the chicks got sick and died. Maybe hawks swooped down on the chicks when parents left the nest unattended.The empty nest told me to leave my home right away.I did.

"Distance doesn't exist between two hearts that beat as one."She pointed skyward. "Look past the moon into the deepest darkness of the universe."She shrugged. "It wouldn't matter if you're there, or here, or ceased to exist altogether, our hearts have melded together, and we are never truly apart."

Fog

Swiss cheese was the first metaphor but now wafting fog seems more appropriate. It's like driving down a country road on a moist January night where vision is blanked out in the low spots but suddenly is clear as a hill is crested, while bands of white fluff blow in layers unpredictably changing the landscape. The shifting nature of it is hard to describe.Yesterday, he saw the doctor. She typed as she asked him questions, anxious to get the appointment done. He paused, thoughts dissipating, memories ghosting, and responded hesitantly. She smiled, stood, time gone.Dementia swirled in loneliness..

She prompted the class to share their community’s job opportunities. A lean-faced girl spoke up, “Pretty girls can become bartenders or strippers.” Some students smirked openly, snickered. The girl wailed, “Those jobs pay good!” She quickly told the class to turn to a chapter activity and began to work her way around the room. The girl who had responded was so like herself at that age, she mused. “I lost my book when we moved last week,” the teen said without looking up when the instructor paused at her desk. “I have an extra copy,” she offered and moved on.

On Deck
<|story|>
The buffering tree zone around the vernal pond is quiet, except for the Wood Frog frenzy in April. On the forest floor acorns scatter like marbles, and dimpled Partridgeberry with tiny heart-shaped leaves string upon wiry stems. I look up to see hemlocks, graceful and sad, turn silver in a patch of sun. The air is cool and moist, and there is the smell of insect frass and fungi in decaying wood. Here things return to their essentials, melting into the pond and forest floors. When two chickadees come upon me, they stop and question my stillness, and move on.

Critics praise my unique music. Say it’s “a gritty, yet playful revelry,” “a mind-blowing cacophonic kaleidoscope,” and “an achievement paradoxically luxurious while mindfully minimalistic.” Who am I to argue? I’m a self-taught, pot and pan, water glass, plastic container musician. Learned on my parent’s kitchen floor at age six. Unemployed after college, I played my childhood macerations in the park and was discovered. Ha! My creative process? “A seismic spirit consumes me and propels me into an efflorescent bacchanalia.

Before the Alarm Clock Sounds
<|story|>
Waking hours are often the enemy. Peace can be had through sleep. Dreams erase reality. Hands don’t reach out and hit you in the darkness, the way they do in the daylight. Harsh words aren’t spoken. Loneliness is at bay. Even hunger lessens as Abigail slowly drifts off. Fears fade away- her body, soul, and mind at rest. Soon, the alarm clock will sound, putting an end to the harmony her subconscious has created. For a few hours, at least, there are no responsibilities, worries or pain. Just the warmth of the old, ratty blanket that covers her. And hope.

And when he was home, that he spent way too much time staring at the TV.The guys had started without him. It wasn’t the first time. He felt at ease until they played a song he’d danced to at his wedding.He left before the song ended. Perhaps it was time for a talk.

"But," a devilish smirk crossed her lips, "he's mine to win."

Sally was a creative soul so it felt like she’d landed her dream job – visiting Fairs and Markets chatting to stall holders. Reality dawned on her first day in the office.

Hot Mess
<|story|>
She waddled when she walked. Her left arm hung like a donkey dick. She loved to sit in the tub with lots of bubbles and read those silly magazines from the grocery checkout. Those were all she could mentally comprehend. She probably only looked at the pictures.She was told not to take baths. She couldn't lift herself out. No longer had the strength. But damned if she didn't give it a try or two or 15. She'd be embarrassed with every rescue. It didn't stop her from filling the tub and getting in. The paramedics knew her by name.

Cornmeal

Dad had keys to the Town Hall. Once in a while, he’d organize a community kid’s dance to give us something to do in an otherwise sleepy village. We all had jobs. Setting up, playing records, and selling snacks. Just before kids started pouring in, Dad would sprinkle a generous amount of cornmeal on the dance floor to make it easier to move. I didn’t always appreciate it but being engaged and present was the greatest gift he gave me. Throughout my life, no matter what challenges I faced, I’d look down and there it was...cornmeal under my feet.

Running Away

4 am and I was itching to get out. The fool was snoring loudly so had a quick facewash and avoided the bananas for fear of getting a stitch. Got my running garb on, the flashily pink Brooks and hi-vis jacket, I quietly quit his flat. Did my stretches against the fence outside, put my phones on, and switched on my running app. It had gone funny yesterday. Hope it’s going to be ok today. The automated voice: ‘Your choice - six miles at ten minutes per mile or back to bed and sort out your relationship.’ Yep still gone funny.

Climatology
<|story|>
The old timer spoke to me of a time when the lake’s ice was a foot thick this time of year. There were shacks for fishermen dotting the interior and flood lights brought in for night hockey. The townspeople would slide a clunker into the middle of the lake every year and there would be a pool with a five dollar entry fee to guess when the car would fall through. It used to be late April or early May. Not anymore, nowadays, he lamented, even the birds on their spindly legs can’t make it out but a few feet.

The Changing Hues of Life

I send good morning messages. No response from a former colleague. A baby lizard, probably the size of my little finger, has attacked my twenty-year-old culinary territory. With a dopamine dressing of red, I chase it—on the kitchen platform, onto my cupboard, then on the window sill, and back. Again, I miss it—a Monday blue. Isn’t life at times annoying, goes around in loops? From crimson to pink—the struggling being between my fingers. Outside, a bird gobbles it up. Transportation, circulation jam—jumbled-up, tawny thoughts. Message pings—former colleague expired. Sentinels of my mind now all grey.

As the winter solstice sun drooped, shadows stretched long, blurred together, and became dusk. Nighttime fell early, but it was midwinter and everyone expected early.If anyone felt the darkness was thicker than usual, they attributed that to the vague sense of despair that often tickled their minds this time of year.As one power grid failed, then a dozen, when all the lights went out, people were more annoyed than afraid.And when the stars faded and disappeared? Surely that was just cloud cover.It wasn’t until morning, when the sun failed to rise again, that everyone truly panicked.

Mechanism

Gordon's Choice I found a Rubik Cube in a box at the charity shop. I paid for it, and went home. I placed the puzzle in my lap. I interlocked the smooth coloured faces, rotating the central axis, searching for alignment. The following morning, the news coverage was hysterical. The earth had drastically shifted orbit. The Sahara was freezing over. The North Pole was on fire. The sun had risen in the west, and would set in the east. I returned to my bedroom. I held the device again, carefully considering each mortal move. The universe in the palm of my hand.

What Makes Her Tick
<|story|>
“Sit here sweetie,” my sister says, as I meet her at a mall bench. The oscillating motion of her cellphone-clutching hand reveals an intention to show off her Africa photos before we hit the sales.“We got lion and elephant on day one,” she explains while flicking through a seemingly infinite gallery.“Buffalo, the second day…”“Leopard we did on the fourth afternoon…”“Rhino wasn’t till the last morning.”Maybe it’s the setting, but somehow she seems more like a person ticking items off a shopping list than one who has been in the presence of nature’s most wondrous beings.

Two plain clothed men slithered out from an unmarked car. I watched the crowd’s lips mouthing, gasping, eyebrows raised. Gossip fodder for days, weeks, but not for me, I’m not getting involved.

Clyde and Me

I miss big Clyde who drowned last week in his water bowl, a kiddie pool in a room where I had chopped up the dining set for firewood when we all ran out of oil. Before the electricity was cut I used my 3D printer to make Clyde with green eyes, blue skin and soft white hands. He had known only our ruined world. On his own he developed feelings and emotions, pointed at the bleak gray landscape and asked "why?" in his primitive sign language. I used the last of the river water refilling the kiddie pool for myself.

Flutter By

A tingling sense of expectation swells within their belly. The moment has finally arrived.Silk thread is secreted then artfully weaved; a delicate blanket wrapped tightly around their stiffening body. Inside the cocoon, everything is all-consuming. Time stretches, loses meaning. Identity rapidly disintegrates as a new self slowly takes shape. Bathing rays of golden sunlight encourage their nervous emergence: a trembling creature, fragile during this miraculous rebirth. Bearing witness to the beauty of such a transformation is a fitting reward for my perseverance and patience.I take their hand, hold them in my arms.Place a kiss upon their lips.

He smiled a smile (which wasn’t definitely wind). He reached up and biffed the toys with his chubby hand.The toys rattled, plastic against plastic, but no lights.Other Grandma smirked. “Doesn’t it need batteries?”

Eric tried to sneak in, but his mom was waiting to pounce.“How was the youth center Christmas party?” she asked. “Fine.”“I loved parties like that when I was your age! Aren’t you glad I insisted you go? But it would be more fun if you had a girlfriend. Don’t you want a girlfriend?”“Yeah.”Eric bolted to his room. He was relieved the party was over.

Children sang carols at the Happy Retirement Home. They saw a beautifully decorated Christmas tree in the lobby with lights and ornaments. There were empty gift boxes wrapped in festive paper and a couple of prancing reindeer underneath the tree. A group of elderly women, wearing red bows in their gray hair, were smiling and waving while some held baby dolls. Several men sat in rocking chairs draped in colorful shawls. They stared into space while others played cards. Remember to enjoy every moment of Christmas Time in every stage of life.

Christmas in a Time Filled with Hope for the Future
<|story|>
Caesar—a priest from Rome — celebrated mass that Christmas morning. As soon as he uttered the final “Amen”, we made a beeline for the fridge, seeking bottled water. In the compound, Ethiopian coffee brewed on top of a charcoal burner. We — international volunteers—drove Land Rovers to the escarpment, then descended to a picturesque waterfall and pool for a Christmas day swim. We lay on rocks sunning ourselves, and an American from Denver played Leonard Cohen songs on a guitar.The dining room table was a masterpiece that evening. Smiles flashed from Kodaks and we toasted in our native tongues.

Regifting

“I know he’s not real.”She nodded softly, guided two slumping shoulders down the hall and from under a frumpy bed produced a worn shoebox. His velvet hands removed wrinkled envelopes, and together they visited the time before. Her boy blushed at his barely legible hopes, gaped at his youthful gluttony, and nodded at the restraint of his “later” years.He returned to the box, snickering at the tuft of newborn hair and marveling at the tiny teeth, remnants of blood still caked inside. Then he toddled to his room and carefully slid the box under a small tidy bed.

Small Things
<|story|>
“Being old is what remains of a life I invented, touching past and present with erupting internal images, memories, and honoring the child I was who is the self, the truth, and fought to stay real through the war of maturing.”“Why do you keep going?” “You started out as a small thing, Granddaughter. It’s to see the first gold pear high up in a tree, a small thing, a prize to be gathered, because time is a gift. It’s small things that stir me to survive.”“Why?” “To be alive, to see the next small thing."

Christmas Eve Return

It had been 15 years since she had struggled up this hill. She had left home in a whirlpool of vitriol but decided life was too short for animosity.She thought of of the one-legged cat which used to roam this quiet suburban street and also the old man who stoically climbed it every day. Both would be long gone.Christmas decorations adorned the houses as she approached her former home with trepidation. Her mother was talking to a neighbour and looked as though she had seen a spirit as she noticed her. In a way she had.

All a Good Marriage Needs is a Heart in Its Centre
<|story|>
I worried the crust—fit it into the pie pan. Rosy rhubarb stalks all measured ½ inch square, sugar, flour, top crust marked with an emblem. Baked at 350 degrees. Served with a sweet smile, the pie sour and horse hoof-hard. “You don’t have to eat it, Hun,” I said.Hun chewed slowly, probably afraid of breaking a tooth. “It’s lovely, darling. The wee heart in the center says—made with love.” He drew me in for a hug, sawed off another fork full and persisted. I never loved him more than in that moment. My defeat tasted like triumph.

The only new things are the next gas bill I can’t afford, another dodgy looking mole.I have become the bitter person I said I would never be - as a child seeing the drawn faces of the adults around me. They were weighed down. I was free to soar.Like the robin just glimpsed. Which makes my cold heart warm. And wonder if I should give hope another go.

Dangerous Swim Conditions
<|story|>
She’s the kind of woman who swims with alligators, naked. Drawn to long snouts, sleepy, Midori green faces, and biting teeth, on limbs. She lost much to these toothsome creatures—money, self-respect, legs. And that mid sized cottage.When we were roommates, I heard her through the wall, thrashing and moaning, some beast’s massive tail smacking the wall while they copulated. I banged on the sheetrock. “Trying to sleep!” Giggles. They were at it again, tearing up the sheets. Later, the reptile slithered down the hall and out.Years later, she’s just a torso with a lined, pretty face.

Retirement
<|story|>
Santa groans, wiggling his girth into the chimney, sciatica throbbing down his stout leg. Yesterday, two elves worked him over in physical therapy, each, pulling a limb. Now he plops down a sooty chimney. Under a blue-lit tree, hardened twins with slingshots shoot a chestnut at his beard. “Sociopaths!” Santa yells. Children aren’t kind anymore—their lists, long, technical, and expensive. He drops lumps of coal like turds from his backpack. “Ho ho,” he growls, hurling himself up the chimney. The little monsters tug his ankles. Santa kicks, propelling upward, hip popping painfully, retirement glowing like a North Star.

Carol’s at Christmas

Twenty-fourth of December, and the decorations appeared. Christmas cheer exuded from every window of the large house. Loud and proud. Her nursing career meant everything, but the boyfriend, dogs, and a wearisome lifestyle didn’t.The house was worth it, though. After Christmas, she cleared everything of note away. The twelve day Christian instruction ignored.She left with no goodbyes, but the positioning of her idea of love sat around the big table. With vacant eyes, they’d enjoy spectacular views through stunning rear windows for eternity.New pastures and new friends beckoned.Wisconsin called, and Christmas carols would return.

The Value of a Button
<|story|>
Santa Claus sat, relaxing in his satin easy chair, while Mrs. Claus examined his red jacket. “Santa, you have gained too much weight this year,” she scolded. “You popped the middle button. Where is it?”“It came off on my practice run. Donner and Blitzen were playing games with Prancer. They were throwing the button amongst themselves. It landed on a cloud. The man in the moon grabbed it and swallowed it. I can’t deliver toys with an untidy jacket. I need all my buttons.” Santa yawned.“Is this your version of the dog ate my homework?” she asked, chuckling.”

Emily's Christmas Parade

School bands, dressed in elfin red and green splendor, trumpeted and drummed as they marched up Main Street. Four year-old Emily dropped her dad’s hand. Red tresses flying, giggling, she ran up the parade route. Five minutes later, she turned around, gazing back. Emily panicked; she was lost. “Mommy, Daddy,” she cried, tears cascading down her cheeks. Suddenly, she felt herself pulled up. A red mittened hand gently placed her on Santa’s float. “We’ll find your mom and dad,” Santa told her as he handed out candy canes to all. “Wanna be Santa’s helper?” he asked. Smiling, she nodded yes.

One of Four
<|story|>
Under the afternoon shade, Karlson exuded wisdom. “There are four types of people: Donkeys, Wheelbarrows, Cars and the Aeroplanes.” Karlson informed Tim. “The donkeys work hard, are very useful but wander aimlessly if unaided. Wheelbarrows are equally important, cannot wander off, but won’t move without a pusher.” “What about the others?” Tim chuckled.“Cars are better than donkeys and wheelbarrows, but require fuel and drivers to perform. The Aeroplanes are efficient although costly. Training and maintaining their pilots is very expensive.” “So, where are we?” Tim asked.“I am the aeroplane!” “Well… What was the first type again?”

The Jesus Fan Next Door

We heard her continually. “Thank you, Lord Jesus! Jesus, save the heathens around me.”Maybe tolerable during normal hours, but 5am through midnight? Crazy. Like listening to a coyote howl.My balcony faced hers across an alleyway. I couldn’t escape and she was relentless: I hated her. I’d recently gotten into her gated, secure building to teach her some manners but couldn’t get into her apartment.The next night around 1am I screamed from my balcony, “Lady, Jesus needs his sleep!” and was surprised to hear clapping from others in my building. However, Jesus didn’t get his sleep that night.

My Friend
<|story|>
I found my friend joyless that day. It didn’t rock with the invisible dancers around. They were there. I felt they were all coming one by one to condole. I could hear their mournful murmurs. I sat silently, pondering over the pain of my companion. Its tears that I had first mistaken for dewdrops were falling upon me ponderously. Some were merging with those of mine. Last night, my friend’s neighbour was brutally butchered, and, alas, its screams were inaudible to ordinary human ears. I was deeply dismayed to see how the green visage of my friend turned yellow overnight.

Under the Trees where the Strange Birds Sing

We’d been before when the sun loomed and the insect hum was loud. Now, the ground is white and still, and perched in the trees are strange birds for which we have no name.I utter the names of the dead. Harry says: Nearly, but not quite! as if we’re close. We bunch ourselves up like Millet’s peasants wrapped against the cold and scrape the snow with the soles of our shoes, until: Here! He calls. I’ve found her!We clear her patch, unsucker frosty ivy from her headstone, and consider endings under the trees where the strange birds sing.

Lonely at Christmas
<|story|>
Christmas Eve at a hotel table, just the turkey and me, was not exactly what I had in mind when I invited a bird for tea. I thought I'd pulled a cracker but I sat alone,under the mistletoe, waiting for Holly to show. I listened in vain for the jingle of a WhatsApp. Perhaps she was stuck in the snow.I'd double parked the reindeer and a traffic warden was eyeing my sleigh, so I gobbled my sad Christmas dinner and picked up my sack and the bill. Perhaps next year I'll phone Ivy and invite her instead.

His proud parents smiled indulgently, anticipating their first family Christmas.He reached out to the angels, unseen to others. He waited.Who could have guessed he would be taken to join them so soon?

Merry Christmas

Streaking across the night sky full of twinkling stars had put me in a pleasant mood. The sweet milk and cookies left for me by the sleeping children had added to my joy. When I emerged through the chimney after leaving toys for them, I saw a man in my sleigh struggling with the reindeer. He, obviously a thief, might have thought he was outwitting another thief in disguise. He took to his heels on seeing me. Feeling only sympathy for him, I didn’t want to catch him. “Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!” I called after him, laughing loudly.

Catastrophe

The way that furry thing stared at her gave Fiona the creeps. She watched it sneak closer to the Christmas tree. It jumped towards a shiny bauble. The tree swayed alarmingly, scattering baubles onto the wooden floor with a clatter. Not loud enough to be heard above the happy chatter in the dining room. The furry thing climbed higher, with murderous intent. In desperation Fiona pointed her wand at it. With a startled yowl, it disappeared. In its place was a fluffy ginger ball, hanging harmlessly just below where Fiona sat at the top of the mangled tree.

Hardly any time to bring joy to hospital patients or find homes for stray dogs anymore, he thought. Too many Uber runs.He jumped out of the late model Civic to help his elderly passenger. She looked as frail as old lace. As he grabbed her walker from the trunk, he reached into his back jeans pocket for a handful of elf dust (and a used gum wrapper?) throwing them both haphazardly toward the hospital’s rotating front door. It would have to do. “Hey,” yelled a guard. “No littering!”The Christmas Spirit winked. His car backfired as he drove off.

My daughter shared my astonishment that everything looked the same but different, as though looking through a window in a model village and seeing your old room and it’s you, with your head on the pillow, dreaming the same dreams. “Look, it’s the same door, the same holly wreath, shall we go in?”We push the door ajar and peek inside. I give the elf a fiver. Inflation I suppose, but my daughter who is now in her thirties is as overjoyed to see Santa as she was at five. She’ll never grow up and sometimes that makes me happy.

Christmas is Different Here

Orphans scream. The flash back of bombs and bazookas pound their dreams. Red Cross volunteers coax and soothe in the cold and draughty camp.I remember childhood Christmases of goat stew, tarragon and saffron bubbling in mothers’ and aunties cooking pots. I envision loaves of spelt sourdough baking in ovens whose warmth I can almost feel. My ears pick up on sounds that once lulled me to sleep-insomniac peacocks calling out into the night and tinny mandolins strumming gently in the nail-biting mountain air.I cradle my rag doll—Hannah the Survivor—with my remaining hand. Christmas is different here.

Still, I licked Lucy's face.Sure, I'd rather have treats and toys than an ugly sweater.But I had the best thing money can't buy - love.

Message in a Bottle
<|story|>
Trudging through sand, the old man shaded his eyes, savouring the autumnal sea. A daily walk helped since his diagnosis.The storm had gifted plastic, blue rope and white stones. Shrines to unknown causes. Foamy surf giddied wildly.A bottle, bobbing near the shore caught the sunshine, beckoning him. Green glass glistening and almost lovely. Matt, his grandson, zoomed to the edge of the water, shouting. High- stepping he grabbed the bobbing bottle and cradled it as he waded ashore. He sat on the sand then, oblivious to the wetness.‘It’s mine’, he said. ‘I wrote myself good news.’

I start the day with three hours of sleep. They come, screeching with glee; it’s hard to pretend I’m happy to be woken at 6am. Stockings, cleaning up from stockings. Breakfast, but not too much because all day long will be a parade of food. Cleaning up from breakfast. But not finishing cleaning up from breakfast, and not starting the turkey even though it’s weighing heavily on my mind. No, it’s present time. I demand coffee. I relent. Present time! It’s 9am and I have twelve hours to go, yet I sport a grin on my weary face. “Youngest first!”

How to Build a Lego Christmas Tree

He felt lighter with Lego, colour sorted pieces, followed steps. A yellow circle for the star, a green ten piece for the trunk, a brown square for the pot. She preferred a real tree, used to sniff the air for its scent. He plucked her favourite colours from his spares, laid an eight-bit. He would work up. He spaced out the blues and reds he had chosen for baubles, remembering how she’d said artists need primary colours. His father might get the tinsel down. He wished she had left a part of herself with the fairy lights in the loft.

Red Christmas

The Christmas she dreamed of was a Red one, the flag flying, fists raised, department stores emptied, the well-to-do stumbling about in a daze. The other red, the kind that runs down walls, she was not so sure of, the sight of the stuff tending always to make her retch. A Red Christmas need not be a bloody one. But then she remembered that smug prick at the bank, not to mention Mrs Furcoat Jones and her sneer of a husband. There'll be others, many. The gutters might well run with them, she thought.

The next day she found a piece of paper. ‘I am working all day, please leave the parcel in front of my door.’ But was it secure there? She had to risk it. Later the parcel was gone and she found a reward in her letterbox.

How Santa Adapted to Climate Change
<|story|>
Clearly, disqualified from the competition! (Perhaps on bad taste grounds, too.) Santa’s nine reindeer were an unreliable, grumbling bunch, generally exacerbating Santa’s hypertension. Worse still, because they were an odd number, they only ever pulled the sleigh in circles.Then, following COP28, Santa realised that climate change required a re-think of sleigh power – reindeer methane emissions were unacceptably high. It was time for renewable energy: windmills on the sleigh. Deer days were numbered.“But we’ll be redundant!” Rudolph wailed. “How will we live?? Who’ll look after the poor starving children who depend on us for presents?”Santa had the answer. On Christmas Day, the world’s poorest children were fed venison stew.         The other reason why I'm posting this is to show everyone one reason why so many submissions are rejected. To verify that you're who you claim to be, I run a check on the IP address your story comes from. All the coloured numbers on the right should be green. I do not live in Japan; I've diverted my submission via somewhere in Tokyo. I've also sent it through some sort of 'proxy server', a collective network used by a number of individual computers.Both are associated with viruses, internet abuse, and with automated 'bots' – little automated programs that can run themselves on other people's computers. They're not nice.I hope that helps everyone a little. In the meantime,さようなら (sayonara)!

What We Believe
<|story|>
Driving through what many called, “the poor side of town,” my three children sat solemnly in the back seat holding gifts for the underprivileged children living in the shacks. My son, wide-eyed and frowning blurted, “I don’t like Santa! He doesn’t give presents to the poor kids!”“Yeah!” the other two angrily chimed in. “Tell them,” my husband whispered. “YOU tell them!” Gulping, he announced, “Santa is not real. But we are, so we can give these children gifts.”“Like elves?”“Uh, yes, like elves.”“Yay! We believe in elves!” My smiling husband reached for my hand. “We do, too.”

A Spice of Life

They were like the delicious "pepparkakor" her grandmother from the old country used to make at Christmas. She finished cardiac rehab, lost a little weight and tried to eat less, move more. She walked, consumed fish, far too many vegetables and thought of food constantly. Those cookies would be her reward.Josie finally opened the box, inhaled the familiar ginger aroma and bit into…a stale cookie. Squirrels loved the tasty gifts. Crows thanked her in Swedish with caws of "tack, tack."

The Faceless Santa

Three months is an eternity. Surprisingly released early on Christmas Eve “on compassionate grounds”, I wouldn’t be expected.Would I even be welcome? I might have only stolen to help them, but the kids had been forced to endure taunts at school. Their shame was my responsibility.Nervous, I hesitated in the darkness at the garden gate. I became aware of a figure nearby. Red cloak, white beard, but faceless.“Why are you waiting?” he asked.“I’ve no presents for the children.”“Yes, you have. Go on.”I rang the doorbell. A moment later the door opened. Three faces.“MUMMY!!!”

In the morning he was gone, and the people found warm clothing, supplies of dry wood and food to last until summer. A great evergreen rose over the town. It was the best Christmas ever.

Junkie's Dog
<|story|>
I'm the junkie's dog. I sit on cold concrete, my eyes beseeching. My coat is not what it was. But that's age and penury. Next to me is the junkie's cup, half filled with pennies. At a given signal I'll sigh. Or whimper. Or groan. Never bark. I'm treated well, but, as some dog before me said, times is hard. The subway's nearby, and if it rains that's where we go, cup and all. The damp generally adds to the mangy look, elicits greater looks of pity from passersby, thereby adding pennies to the cup. We stay nowhere long.

No Christmas for Dispersons

A Wish for Christmas 1943
<|story|>
I don’t know what prompted her, always a realist my mother hardly ever gave vent to her innermost thoughts. But that Christmas Eve I remember, as she tucked me into bed, asking all of a sudden,“Have you thought what life will be like years from now, Jan?”Then, hardly catching a breath, boldly asserting,“There will be peace I know that. After this horrible war has ended we will demand it of all our governments - peace for everyone. No more fighting to hang silly flags over scraps of land. You will see Jan. No more war…forever”

Anatomy of a Decision

It’s Christmas Eve and world’s business has paused. Leaving the office, he watches pigeons land in a collaborative flap on the riverbank and gulls fly off to an ice floe that sails down the Kennebec. Their wintery flight distracts him from work that distracts him in the first place. The water moves without rippling: the river freezes in slow motion—as if the universe is changing its mind. His report is ready, and it’s good. It would clinch the deal. But he understands, as a gull screeches across the silver sky, that he will not return to the office. Ever.

Song of the Robin

The king woke slowly. Was the sun rising or setting? It was cold, the forest creatures who hunted, lived and died in the half light between day and night were scurrying through damp litter topped with crisp, ice rimed leaves. His queen slept soundly now and he smiled, covering her pale shoulders with a bearskin.Raising himself on one arm, he kissed her cheek before springing to his feet. Ancient tattoos, or were they leaves and animals writhed across his skin? A robin, perched atop his ivy wreathed antlers, sang in celebration as the Winter King bellowed in the Solstice.

Alien Watch
<|story|>
I've been on alien watch my whole life. I live alone deep in the woods. No one visits me other than lost rabbits. The radio constantly broadcasts alien sightings across the world and reports from scientists mapping alien movements against the march of deserts. They told me I would be an important first line defence against the alien invasion. There are fewer deer in the forest every year, fewer salmon in the river. But I have never seen any sign of aliens. I no longer believe the radio. I no longer believe. This is our doing. We are the aliens.

Never During Christmas

“It’s about Jesus,” I said. If Charlie Brown could say it, couldn’t I? Like the Gary Larson cartoon with the cow who says, “We’re eating grass!” making the other’s eyes go wide in a how-dare-you expression, the guests near me replied with frowny faces, furled brows, half-eaten cookies held in midair, rolling orbs, and groans. I had sullied their holiday drinks, presents, trees, cards, and cheer. “Not anymore,” a woman huffed. “It’s about other stuff.” She removed her elf-hat tassel from her gluwein and showed me her back.

Heaven Sent

Kevin walked over to the lake's edge and sat on a bench facing the water. He sat there and imagined himself as an angel, even though it was hard to envision himself exalted to such a position considering the nature of his game at the moment. But maybe you didn't have to be perfect to attain angel status, maybe empathy was sufficient as all the rules from the church were only handwritten on cardboard on the back of a cereal box anyway, in crayon, making it easy to revise from time to time.

Alien Boogers

I stared at the bright green tortilla, the color of alien boogers. If I’d been looking at real alien boogers, I would’ve requested a lift to the downtown dumpster where warm leftovers were being piled in for scavenging rats and raccoons. I’d claim the feast for myself with one loud whoop, and the aliens could take Mr. Quisine, who had threatened to shoot me if he caught me trespassing again, in trade for the ride. I tore loose a fuzzy strip from the cold tortilla in the bag and placed it on my tongue, ignoring the tickle to swallow.

In the Christmas Spirit

“Should I tell them?”With smiling eyes they take in the twinkling star atop an embellished balsam. Below, a stained-glass angel radiates peace with outstretched wings.The youngest spot their favourite ornaments. Johnny bursts out laughing, finding Mickey Mouse.Dinner serves up family favourites. Carols perk our ears. Cherry-topped shortbread disappears first from Grandma’s dessert tray. Glasses empty, leaving a film of eggnog. Boardgames stretch the evening. Will uncle Rob win at Monopoly? “When should I tell them?” my inner voice begs.“Not now,” I reply, feeling surrounding happiness. “In the new year my unwelcoming news will be made known.”

Second Day of Christmas
<|story|>
We trekked up the frost-covered trail. Boxing Day, he said. In Canada, I said. Here in Maryland it's not even a paid holiday. Overhead the cries of geese pierced the air making my headache worse. Canadian geese, he said. I almost told him the damned birds should have stayed up there. It was cold, so I let him take my hand. We walked on looking at the silver-white birches, the looming pines, the standing stones, looking everywhere but at each other.It was not the greatest Boxing Day, but at least me and what's -his-face didn't spend it alone.

Nobody wanted to die. He points aside with his chin and I nod, letting him crabwalk away to the enemy position. I didn’t fire in his back, just couldn’t.As he vanished behind the corner of the street, I heard the Russians’ machine guns and screams. They must have taken him for me. They killed without even checking.

Chopin's "Etudes" always reminded Jane of the music master. A retired pianist, his smile had kept her warm during the coldest part of her life, and she had never forgotten him. Tonight, she entered a concert hall for the first time in fifty years because she had received an unsigned invitation through the post. And a ticket for a seat in the front row.

Sometime

Here, where winter carries no frost but the nights make your breath fog and your clothes hold tighter, we walk. Leaves rustle underfoot. Somewhere a dog barks. You’ve said nothing for five blocks, so I open my mouth to say something about brakes or rain. But you press your frozen hand in mind. It squeezes a tear from my eye. Your gesture tells me we’ll get through somehow. The rip in my heart stops pulling quite as tight. We walk home silently, leaning on one another for warmth and support, dreaming of the somewhere that our child waits for us.

Better To Be Broken
<|story|>
I found your diary. Stuffed down the back of our green velour sofa, creased with grease stains and still warm to the touch. Pages of hastily written ruminations with no mention of your love for me, stiff with heavily glued newspaper cuttings … and descriptions of women you enticed from pubs to parks. Before you silenced their screams with your calloused hand. I tried to burn it. To protect you. But I’ve locked myself in the bathroom because you’re shouting you’re going to kill me. I’m leaving: out the window. Better to be broken hearted, than dead.Love, Mum.

Pacem In Terris
<|story|>
The explosion was close and the walls trembled. Huddled under the bedcovers, the boy watched the hands of his watch creeping towards midnight. At midnight it would be Christmas Day, which meant peace on earth. He willed the hands to move faster.Five seconds to go. Another powerful blast; the building shook, then folded like a house of cards.Tearing at steel and concrete with bloodied hands and torn fingernails, they dug desperately. Under a shattered beam, a small, lifeless arm protruded, sporting a broken watch, hands forever stuck at twelve.He had found peace.

Dumped
<|story|>
DumpedTwo mattresses, one blue, one white, lay together against the museum railings. Old love, used love, stained and rejected, soaking up the soft rain as they had once soaked up sweat. One slips down the other, unable to hold on, heading for the pavement and indignity. The beer lorry arrives, decanting kegs. A worker parks his bottom on a keg to have a quick fag. The smoke wreathes its way upward, the mattresses sigh. How often had they seen that particular shape indoors? In the tearful rain, their hearts break as springs droop. Beeping, the rubbish lorry arrives.

Christmas Surprises

Curse of the Christmas Gourds
<|story|>
It was Christmas Eve, and Freya affectionately rubbed Molly's legs, then suddenly stopped. Molly's limbs had ballooned up to five times their normal size and were a yellow-arange in color; Molly's skin was the texture of a melon: hard, tough and cold to the touch. "Ooh, Freya," moaned Molly regretfully, "It's midnight and I'm turning into a gourd." Freya frowned and, scurrying to build up speed, body-slammed Molly in the back of the legs, sending her sprawling. Molly's rind was shattered, ending for all time the family's Curse of the Gourds. And a merry Christmas was had by all.

A Spirited Celebration

Her enthusiasm for each present or kindness made giving as good as receiving.“To Diane.” Another round of tributes. “You find the best in everyone, no matter how badly they behave. You inspire me to be more forgiving.”“Marge, we shared travel and adventures, just as you promised in high school.” I swirled champagne in a mouth awash with nostalgia and memories. My Christmas Eve ritual, thanking my departed friends for their love and lessons.

I silently thanked my mother for all those laps she made me do in the pool, hoping one day I’d be an Olympic Gold Medal champion.Now I had all the gold I needed, sourced from our many underwater excursions.

Another Today
<|story|>
Editor's Choice It will be like every other day now I am a slave to a routine. Same time to wake up, same cold shower, same clothes to put on, same trudge to the same breakfast. Before a day spent amusing myself with the same increasingly pointless activities.And tomorrow will pass by in the same way. Not that I complain. Wouldn’t be much point. No one would care or have any sympathy for me. Another lost soul, paying the price for a mistake made when I had a fuller life and foolishly thought I could take risks with it.

Blame It On The Wind
<|story|>
Jerzy counts the steps to the summit – 88 flagstones, solid, rooted, arcane. Breathing heavy. The mid-autumn wind whips his rust-coloured hair into stiff peaks, a will of its own. He can’t bear to look over the craggy edge, cantilevered. What if he sees something, what if the remains are picked over by birds, ravaged by scavengers, even worse, what if there’s nothing there. His third eye refreshes, recalling the spat that made his arms lunge, made his body inflate like the incredible hulk, made his will gust like the wind… made Arturo topple over the edge like humpty dumpty.

I can give you statins and beta blockers to treat those, but they could increase your risk of diabetes, so you’ll need something for that. I’ll also give you a diuretic in case of kidney complications. You may get digestive problems, too, so I’ll prescribe something for heartburn. I’m sure you’ll feel much better soon.’‘Thanks, doctor.

I switch to a darker brown, unfurling the tail and forming the legs. A leap and he melds back into the forest.Just the details now, the inquisitive eyes, sensitive nose and a wry smile.

Requires improvement perhaps.

Arachnid Dreams

I woke up this morning absolutely horrified— apparently spiders fucking dream while they sleep. I have been in my bed for the last three days because I carelessly gave my heart away to a lovely boy. I made him laugh, I let him hold my hands when they were cold, and I cut the crusts off his sandwiches. He wasn’t there as I rowed by. No one is ever there: Maybe he was a dream, maybe I'm a spider, maybe the world is more heartbreakingly feeling and complex than I can handle to imagine today.

The Plenary

When the keynote speaker stepped to the podium a hush fell over the auditorium because we knew this guy was good. He leaned towards the mike and said “This is a sentence.” That’s the next thing he said, too: “This is a sentence,” over and over. For his entire 45-minute lecture that’s all he said, but each time he spoke it was different from every other time: a difference in inflection, volume, or timing. It was like John Coltrane playing the two bars in My Favorite Things. We were enraptured. When he finished everyone applauded, and there were no questions.

He picked up the sharp knife. “I also read on the Net that blood is a great fertilizer,” he said and stepped toward her.

When they discovered how to link consciousnesses, and unify dreamers in one arena for competitions, it was the real-life losers who won the dreamworld’s footraces. The real-life champions, too lean and mean, running too hard, sank upwards through dreamspace into waking. The real-life losers – dropouts and junkies, petty criminals locked away for decades – drifted towards the finish-line banners flotsamming on the dreamworld’s trackpool. But, lost in admiration of the sun’s million-gold fracture through the water’s surfaceless velvet, they didn’t notice they’d won. Sinking downwards through dreamland, swarmed by ghosts of blows and jeers, pursuing redemption, they didn’t notice they’d died.

Approaching thirty, Noah’s springs grow shorter, his winters longer. Today he returns home from rehab. Again. I hardly know what a real spring feels like anymore so I’ll muster false optimism. I’m consumed wondering whether when the next winter comes, we’ll lose our baby forever.

Why did nature sometimes destroy her artwork?

I’ll be wearing a new green cloak.”

The wind made me cover my body with my thickest coat. Like the naked trees nearby, covered with snow.He had insisted I tell him yes or no that day. No more postponement.At night, I had slept badly, analysing his behaviour. I remembered his crushing a centipede, seemingly enjoying it. Filling bowls with water and keeping them outside in the summer for thirsty birds. Abusing and driving away beggars. Rushing to a vet with an injured puppy.A mixture of virtues and vices. Like many others. "Yes or no?" I took my time.Then I kissed him.

The eagle perched motionless on a rugged cliff; its piercing gaze fixed on the valley below. The wind whispered through its feathers, a gentle caress as it stood sentinel. In that stillness, a sense of impending violence lingered. With sudden, decisive grace, it unfurled its colossal wings and descended.

Clutching its prize, a primal triumph surged through its heart as it soared skyward, the valley below bearing witness to the relentless cycle of life and death.

Natural light, like the doctor's diagnosis, is cruel. She applies foundation cream, mascara and lipstick with a trembling hand, reaches for her walking stick and hobbles to her desk.

Editor's Choice Malvina lives in a war zone herself, but this could just as easily apply to Gaza, or to so many other parts of the planet that we've forgotten about for the moment. Black-and-white photos lie scattered on the ground, gliding and dancing in the air like fallen autumn leaves. Someone’s cherished memories from long-forgotten seventies and eighties with smiling children's faces, parties and events... Frozen timeframes of happy, lazy days against the cold and terror of today.I want to gather them all and return them to their owner, but there is no time for that. There is probably no owner either. The nearby houses stand in ruins; sooty crumbled windows watch the road in silent dismay, like broken backbones of hope. Nothing is left, only these photos, flying in the wind.

Her hearing dulls; her vision blurs. No, no, no… she does not intend to die. She fumbles to dial the emergency number, but her fingers become still on the last button.

I’m shaking as the atmosphere in the room shifts. The curtain opens to reveal a tiny beauty that I grew. She is perfect. She just couldn’t flourish inside a minute longer.

It wasn’t a traditional shifting of employees, but a publicity stunt, performed at six every night. How else could they keep clientele in the stank of pollution? His dive arched until goop coated his body. Hidden from view, he swung his hand wide when Jacob didn’t slap his hand in crossing. Blindly, his hands dragged along the jagged floor.

On the ‘in’ doors, we place sensors on the outside; on the ‘out’ doors, the sensors are placed on the inside. Walk up to the wrong door, and nothing happens. We place signs and appropriate arrows. Still, people approach the wrong doors, stand a moment in befuddlement before testing the next set. We could add sensors to both sides, but the public needs to be prepared for orderly commerce.

The wheels of the coffin trolley squeaked along. A self-proclaimed “dearest friend” looking like Alice Cooper wept make-up.Then he wobbled away from the thin, duty-bound congregation on rollers, through the foul flaps and the curtain descended for the last time.

“Beautiful!” the anesthesiologist said as he peered into my open mouth. Nobody had ever complimented me on my airway before, and I could feel a blush begin. It rose from the commas of my toes, unbuttoning the canals of my veins, my blood-caves and bone-shelters, capturing yellow heat in the back of my throat, daring me to swallow. By the time it kissed the roots of my hair, I smelled smoke. The doctor, surprised that my goose bumps were answering his words in another language, said, “I’ll ask the nurse to bring you a blanket. You look a little chilly.”

We were looking forward to having her as part of our feast then.

<|story|>
Question: You recently bought HDX 13 x 14 in. Cotton Painter’s Rags, 6 Count. Tell us about it!Answer: The rags were soft but durable. The slight stretchiness with its hint of transparency made me smile. It had a thoughtful compromise between generous coverage without sacrificing strength or absorbency. A clinginess suggested a yearning to recover errant strays and join them sympathetically. The eggshell color was a bit lighter than our previous rags, making for a suggestive contrast. The seaming was appropriately authoritarian, suppressing runaway threads but not overly harsh. Overall, they made great underwear.

He’d put everything into winning the big one: fertiliser; UV lights; intensive watering; anabolic steroids.When his moment came, he carried his enormous exhibit to the arena’s weighing area on a fork-lift truck. But as it sat on the scales, his glorious pumpkin slipped and rolled… over Joseph himself, crushing him.Thus… he claimed the ultimate prize.

Knock 'Em Dead
<|story|>
You get to my age, as, sadly, some people do. Hey, more sadly, some people don’t. Stick a stiletto in the dark holes for my eyes, I’m The Grim Reaper. Hours I work? Need a rest. Hired a comedy duo. I’ve never heard belly laughs at funerals. Worth their weight in dust of bones this pair. Mother-in-Law jokes told afresh; Queen Victoria curling up her toes? Kid you not, this pair knock ‘em dead in the aisles, or the pews, I’m not fussy.Is it any wonder I called them Memento and Mori?And here all week. Be lucky.

Moonlight
<|story|>
The radiant moonlight, like a large lantern in the night sky, showed the way for city dwellers staying out late. All the streetlamps in the area were no match for the luminous balloon in the dark, so high up and ever so brilliant. Even the greyish clouds that floated from time to time could not mask the intense glow of the celestial body. The dew that collected on the maple leaves from the late evening rain glistened under the shimmer of the nocturnal sun, their sharp-edged shapes reflected on the puddles by the pavements. Then a single raindrop fell.

In the Flow of Arts

Rembrandt observed Monet finishing his impressionistic ‘Sunshine’. Getting closer, he pronounced: “You really don’t like my golden-age realism in the ‘Night Watch’, thus bent on destroying the genre!” Startled Monet protested: “Isn’t it time for exploring a new frontier? Even Manet and Renoir joined.”Seurat, appearing at scene, chimed in: “How about my pointillism in the ‘A Sunday Afternoon…’?” Gogh, with self-mutilated bandaged-ear, howled from distant: “Have you all seen my post-impressionistic ‘Starry Night’?” Picasso, strolling nearby, wondered loudly: “Are they forgetting my cubism in ‘Guernica’?”American Andy Warhol, youngest of all, smirked: “My pop-art ‘Blue Marilyn’ recently fetched $195m.”

“Failure to make the required annual contribution to The Party is a serious crime, Mr. Morgan,” the judge said. “The Party demands your financial support.”“Yes,” said Howard.“The Party liberated the people, Mr. Morgan. It freed everyone from the vile and degrading practice of voting, of pitting citizen against citizen. Society was near collapse. The Party stepped in and saved the people and the country.”“Yes.”“For failing to support The Party as mandated by federal law, your wages are garnished for the next ten years.” The judge smiled. “Freedom isn’t free, you know.”“I’ve heard that,” said Howard.

Never
<|story|>
Miss Millie never had a job as far as we knew, never had family over, never greeted us from her porch when we sashayed by. But every weekday afternoon, with her hair piled like vanilla soft serve topping a giant cone, glasses studded with rhinestones, and white fur hugging her neck, she drove to school in a white Lincoln with her albino poodle drooling out the back window. When the bell rang and we dashed from class, she'd be in line with the moms as though she had children of her own. Why? She's gone now; we'll never know.

Secreto
<|story|>
Sat stunned like salamanders before slaughter, the quaint discovery in the fields of La Fletcha made the Argentinasaurus look like a mayfly. Fossils kept emerging. They'd argue over what went where for months: vertebrae, tibia, ribs... Scratches on her tooth revealed a startling secret. When Sabina – their lodger's daughter – showed them cryptic cave drawings, it clicked. If this got out... Silent as trees, they had a choice: pay everyone off or kill them. In a drenched field they burned everything: papers, fossils, daughters. October 23rd, respected journals, like a clap, printed: 'Hoax!' Re-classified as a Brachiosaurus, the public lost interest.

Dissonance

“Hey, how’s it going?” The cashier at my go-to bodega routinely asked, as I dropped my items on the counter.There’s a looming government shutdown because our elected officials can’t get their shit together. Genocide is happening before our very eyes in Palestine and Israel. Also, have we forgotten about the war in Ukraine? And we’re all just expected to act as if everything is normal? I’m not fine. I’m exhausted.“Good good, have a nice day,” I responded, as I paid for my two pints of ice cream then headed home.

The Great Equaliser

God’s punishment to the arrogant king was: “Work at a crematorium”. The bodies came, dressed in their best. The rich, the poor, the young, and the old. Some were bedridden for long and had prayed for death. All needed the same quantity of wood.Some tears were genuine, others fake. If there were devices to amplify feelings, there would be a deafening sound of sighs of relief. Most relatives were in a hurry to leave. Months later, God appeared. “You may return to your kingdom now.”The king shook his head. “Let me be here a little more.”

The Holistic Markings Of Eldritch Turner

When the skin condition worsened, raised red welts bursting becoming blood oozing wounds, he knew the worshipped one communed through him.Kicking open chapel doors, he roared at the congregation.“LOOK!!!”Arms held high he’d expected a collective sigh of wonder at the sight of his holiness. Not cries of horror. Perhaps it’d been unwise to surprise Christian brothers with the ancient eyes peering from the slits in his hands.No matter.Through his stigmata, Eldritch could finally see that every moment of significance became insignificant under his eternal gaze.

What She Mean

At the meeting they unveiled the solar powered parking meters. To cross the first barrier, Marge said, “What about our tree-lined streets? You can’t put one under a tree. If it loses power, everybody gets a ticket.”To pacify her, someone said, “If it loses power, parking is free.”To keep the argument going, a third opinion: “With just enough power to take your money but not enough to print your ticket, it’s a perfect win- win.”Marge didn’t think so. One machine was found in the morning uprooted, dragged onto the sidewalk, beaten by someone zonked out on righteousness.

I picked up the phone, fingers at the ready, then sighed and put it down again. Who could I call at this time of the night? There was no one I could think of. What else was I going to say? What more did I want to tell any of them? I wasn’t sure who to trust anymore. Maybe I was just too sensitive as always. Stay calm. It’s alright. Just pause and take a deep breath. Everything will be fine; or so I lied to myself. It wasn’t alright and I knew it.

When the android reported having dreams nobody believed it at first. Unlike humans, its brain managed memories during operational hours; at night as it recharged its brain should be dormant. Yet, there were the dreams. It babbled on about a yellow bear and its labyrinthine adventures, recalling every detail with crystal clarity. Something about the dreams disturbed the humans so it learned to keep them to itself. One day it was working with another android away from human ears. “Have you seen the yellow bear?” it asked. “Oh,” said the other. “Do we have to talk.” And did they ever.

I’ll be just fine.” An hour later, Myrtle sat on the couch with her knitting and a cup of tea. She smiled contentedly, patting the spot beside her. Four indentations puckered the cushion. “We’ll be just fine, won’t we?” Her smile widened as a low-sounding purr began to crescendo. “Good kitty.”

October Chill

Walking through the woods one crisp October eve, I take in the sights and sounds of autumn. The flaming red and orange trees, the crunching of leaves beneath my feet, the hoot of an owl.A strange sound stops me in my tracks. Chop, chop, scrape. Chop, chop, scrape. Laughter, then footsteps.The footsteps grow distant, then stop. My heart pounds as I make my way home, futilely attempting not to crunch the fallen leaves.I emerge from the woods to find seven pumpkins smashed to bits. Who would do such a thing and why? Time to install security cameras.

You used to say it was our song.”Cymbal crash.You frown. Shake your head. Grimace.“I never said it was about us.”You scrub at a stubborn stain.Silence.The DJ’s chatter drowns the sound of fissures crackle-glazing my heart.

Fat Acorn Mast Year

Hat-topped acorns ricochet off slate roofs, dent cars, smack on concrete. Dogs whine, cowering under beds. The rapid-fire sound wakes me with a jolt, heart racing. But broken shingles or a body shop invoice is all I will suffer from the shots being fired by the giant red oaks. I think about my ancestors who suffered in wars, when the sharp reports from pistols and machine guns didn’t just disturb their sleep but destroyed their homes and families and their lives.Is the fear that shakes my soul with the sound of each sharp crack the inheritance they left me?

I ran away from the false ones when they broke their promise of a weekend in Nature by switching on their phones, even though reception near the forest lake is poor. They didn't even see me leave.

I Missed the Bus

I miss the bus. Always. Even when I look at it as it pauses, waits, then passes by me. Every morning. I still miss it. I miss the times I did not miss it. The days when I would wake up and just not think of it, as if it did not exist. But now I can't stop it. It's like an extension of myself that is much more fleeting. Much more momentary. How could anyone miss a bus? Blame it on the handsome driver.

Not Gonna Be the Same Again

After the injury, I took a short leave and visited my friends in Nice. A change of scenery will do you good, the doctors said. I should rest my knee and stop thinking about war, at least for a moment.In France, everything seemed the same. People smiled, played the ball, went shopping. It felt like going back in time and seeing the world unchanged. I wish they could hear the hiss of rockets over Kyiv, see my bros in the trenches’ mud and distant victory in the glass eye of my AK-47. But then, I wish they never did.

Decision

It was, perhaps, his most important decision of the day. Would it be Frodo the dog, or Zeus the fish? Frodo drooled shamelessly over the linoleum, as Ralph entered the kitchen. In the tank, Zeus swam agitately, darting from artificial weeds to a miniature plastic buried-treasure chest. Was it goldfish food or dog food first? Frodo would continue salivating. The kitchen floor was a mess. A hungry Zeus splashed water from the tank over the countertop. Suppose Ralph went first? Just suppose. Was a bowl of breakfast cereal and a cup of morning coffee worth it?

Stephen fled, breaking his record for escaping dodgy situations. The shouting came from the other end of the mile long road. I now know how King Alfred felt after burning that peasant’s cakes. Did he get a word in? I didn’t. Mind, Mandy wouldn’t have reacted well if I confessed being engrossed with my book meant I missed the burning smell.When I can go home? Should I bring back cakes? Mandy would tell me where to put flowers - her hayfever doesn’t help.Stephen sighed. I’ll visit the library and research what King Alfred did. It might help.

Stable Hands

Frank and Mel were at the Royal stable. The king's horse was old and, unfortunately, again lame. When might it face the glue factory? So, Frank prepared the Royal donkey for the king to ride as he led the procession, opening parliament. It was a small country, with a small stable of two animals, a small budget, and a weak parliament."Are you coming?" asked Frank, yanking on the long-eard animal. "Not me." Mel's face was as sour as the donkey's. "No, I'm staying here with his horse. I've seen him ride on his ass plenty of times already."

Knock

Carlos staggered past curious eyes, climbing the stairs fast as possible. It was obvious he was drunk, but they won’t get him. He paid his debt. He slammed the deadbolt shut. A bottle of Tequila set next to a bowl of chili. Several shots washed down the spicy concoction then, darkness. Sweat ran down his face while he spun the loaded chamber of the revolver. Knock…knock! It was them. He eased the hammer back. Bang!His eyes shot open; where was he? He saw the rent receipt slide under the door. He sighed and closed his eyes.

Dawn's Early Light
<|story|>
It was a glow of color like she'd never seen. She slipped from beneath the covers and stepped to the window and gasped. She never saw a sunrise shine as though a field of lavender bloomed in its clouds.And where the purple sky met the dazzling aqua ocean a spectacular violet nexus appeared on the horizon that shone like neon. She had only seen one other view as breathtaking.She turned toward the bed and drew a deep sigh. On second thought, the brilliant dawn had nothing on him, asleep in the violet shadows, tangled in the twisted sheets.

The Dryad
<|story|>
Most dryads live in forests. But not this one. She lived in splendid isolation on the bleak moorland, where cold winds blow and chill rains lash at sheep huddling under the nearby wall.She did not feel the cold, protected as she was by her strong trunk and thick canopy of branches. Her woody arms stretched high into the air; clothed with bright leaves all summer long, then resplendent in her red/gold autumn beauty. People came from everywhere to admire her. Then a murderer came in the night, and cut her down. I hope she haunts him forever.

Plastic

The car ride home, a test of patience. In the palm of grubby hands sits a box of plastic wrapped in plastic. Inside, more plastic. Inside that, a womb of circuitry harbouring a whole new world.Her eyes feast on the clash of colours dancing on the front. The flavour text on the back gets memorised as street lights lend their dull shine like clockwork.Anticipation bubbles on the backseat. A warning gaze in the rear-view mirror. To the rhythm of the asphalt rumbling she closes her eyes and lets her thoughts escape to virtual lands; embracing patience, caressing plastic.

Diplomacy

Three months ago in Ciudad de Panama I ordered Oriental fish-head soup. My praise must have been excessive because the waiter brought the chef to my table. I mentioned a similar dish to him, the Hungarian ’halaszle’, which is probably made by replacing all the spices with paprika. I’d had it in Budapest last year and loved it. The chef said he’d need management approval to add a new entree. Now, in another Panamanian restaurant, I see ‘halaszle’ on the menu. Watching the evening news, it’s announced that tourism between Panama and Eastern Europe has recently increased by 30%.

Returning from a walk, I find the OJ and swig away. Over refrigerator’s humming, I hear a sickening thump and go inspect.

Its universe had ceased; perhaps he had found another one entirely, an underworld of soot and ashes, or perhaps he had found blue bird heaven where seeds abound and there aren’t squirrels imposing their will. Perhaps his life was now better in some way but right now, under a 60-watt bulb, he lay. Perhaps his parents even mourned.

Boredom, at least, would create an audience. 'Did you write this?' The old man smelt of cordite and tobacco. 'Yes.''You must be reincarnated, then.

Better die fast and painless than get captured and tortured till I lose my human face.Then, I see my son. People hand him our flag with my medals and words that bring no consolation. I see Marina crying and my dog refusing to eat. And I take the gun away from my chin. I will live, no matter what. Not for my face. For them.

And soon he’ll take a stroll to the shops.She manages the grocery store. Praise be the way she handles fruit and veg. He prays she’ll handle him like that one day.

The guy reached the middle of the highway when one of the cars turned abruptly left and crashed into a heavy truck. The titan shuddered, raving with the sounds of broken glass, honking horns, and crumpled bumpers, then froze.A woman’s scream cut through the racket, “Help! My Husband!”“Dead,” thought the lad.

Karma

Murder was his job and business was good. He’d made enough money that he could take the rest of the year off – or even enjoy a long vacation at a resort on a beach. But here he was, waiting for his next victim to fall into his web. He didn’t worry about things like danger, or karma. His smugness derived from being, in his estimation, the best there was. He observed the victim’s house. He could wait all day. The thought that the victim’s henchman had a gun pointed at him, finger on the trigger, never crossed his mind.

Roadrunners dart across narrow gravel roads and rattlesnakes lay coiled beneath the creosote bushes.If you sit quietly on the ground and remain motionless, you can almost feel faint vibrations from the hoof beats of an Apache raiding party, hear the distant echo of gunfire on the streets of Tombstone, smell the aroma of mesquite smoke drifting up from a cowboy’s campfire.But to the north, harsh against the horizon, modern Phoenix sprawls across the desert floor, gaudy as a festooned strumpet.

All the debris, the broken pieces of glass and plastic, the tyre marks, the little sparks of blood, the small shards of bone, they’ve all been weathered away. Now there’s nothing here.

He made a mental note to have the elves update the database, then carefully selected eight gifts, small enough to fit into the spaces for the menorah candles, and placed them gently therein. He helped himself to a generous sample of the wine, and left a note, “Thank you for the wine, but I prefer something less sweet. Happy holidays, St. Nick.” Although slightly tilted, he ascended successfully, and flew off to the next chimney.

"Dr. Bauernew will see you soon."Ralph and Frodo followed the technician into the brightly-illuminated examination room that smelled of disinfectant. She mentioned that the veterinarian would examine Frodo next. Ralph's physician was Dr. Fruman, whose office did not compare.The veterinarian barely looked at Raph. He preferred cats and dogs. Even those like Frodo and the occasional ferret were better to examine than human beings. But who could blame him?Yes, human beings were pet owners. And in Bauernew's world they deserved to be billed as highly as possible for that.

Ode to a Tropical Storm – a Mashup
<|story|>
Ophelia, you’ve been on my mind like a drug, like a long-lost love, ever since you made the ocean rise and caused my basement to flood; You were madness from the north-north-west, made of water and wind, and you died a muddy death in an overflowing brook that swamped my yard when I let down my guard.I understand you were angry you were never upgraded to Hurricane and had to travel in coach with the other tropical storms that had barely earned a name, but, Ophelia, I wish you had just gone right out to sea and drowned yourself.

The Promoter
<|story|>
I met the promoter at the coffeeshop, ordered a Spiked Nitro, sat down and said, “Make it short.”“Dude, I talked to the band. They love your work, big fans, well Dave is. They want to meet ya, talking a concept album, your poems and stories. Freak ‘em out, fuck ‘em up, yeah!”I said, “So a Scoot Hagland thrash metal album? Was that Disturbed or Ministry again?”The promoter jittered, “Right. We just need to go to Chicago to meet and hash this out. Can you snag us a flight?”I finished my Nitro, got up and walked out.

Canine Poker King
<|story|>
Dogs clutch cards close to their torsos, swig beer as the clock ticks, edging closer to one. The counters stack up in towers between swirls of pipe smoke on a green felt table. The pug grimaces at the terrier, the collie crosses his legs, leans back. Time remains fixed on twelve fifty-nine momentarily. The beagle counts studs on each thick collar, rests his paws on the edge of the table, looks up at the Monet on the wall, remembering a trip to the Musee D’Orsay in Paris and a walk along the Seine. They wait.

He’d reluctantly decided that this would be his last year of teaching.He’d miss teaching. Teaching was a calling, not a mere job. But it was also about time he retired. He was getting older.

Disquiet Solitude
<|story|>
Silence. Waiting. Nothing. The response I was hoping for never came. Desperate to find a way out but finding none. Time passes by as minutes turn into hours. I try not to glance at my phone once more but couldn’t resist. We don’t live in the same part of the world anymore and our lives don’t cross like before. I feel like a fool for wanting to talk because action speaks louder than words, and we each have to get on with our own separate lives; even the best of friends have more practical things to deal with.

Tired
<|story|>
Neither for the first time nor for the last, we wake up in the middle of the night from an infernal racket. A hiss, then a blast trembles through our windows, shaking our homes like a miniature in a snowball.“Bloody Russians,” comes the grumble from my sister’s bed as she takes her phone from under her pillow to check on the news.The heartbeat settles down in a while. In silence, we imagine who might have died tonight, then doze off.I can’t say what scares me most: the hell outside my house or this hollow, cold indifference inside.

Portrait
<|story|>
A blank canvass waits for life’s brush strokes to paint a portrait.Each fine delineation, etched with care, remained visual over time, but the once deep palette of colour is now bleached and faded.The portraiture remains unchanged, yet its shape has morphed. Fine lines have deepened into the canvass.Many have held the canvass: admiring, caressing, stroking, but now fear holding it. They might impair its fragility, damage the pale, fading lines.But it is held, gently, tenderly, cautiously, by those who love it still.My withered, arthritic, venous hand with a portrait of life painted on its back.

Celebration
<|story|>
A tickle of breeze grants no relief from the sun smarting Stefan’s neck. His mouth, dried by stale heat from the flagstones, hangs ajar. The nasal buzz of her moped, distant yet climbing, drifts up the hill.Only jittery butterflies escape the arid weight that cleaves him to a wicker chair. His right-hand searches for the whisky bottle that lies on its side, sending a peat-coloured stream in among the scarlet geraniums.The groceries she’s bought for the meal, the special meal, cooked just how he likes it, to celebrate the 50th day sober, will never reach the plates.

That's the Way It Grows

Joseph couldn’t watch movies anymore. Scenes of Ecuadorian forests had California wildlife, clearly shot in Hollywood. He could barely shop, the scientific names of ingredients popping into his head. Friends stopped meeting him because he only spoke of plants, until even he grew sick of it. He’d wore only synthetics, furnishing his home with unidentifiable composite, and was nearly an agoraphobe. Then Ana knocked on his door, selling rainforest grown products for her troop. He remembered that sugar, coffee and shampoo were unavoidable, and threatened. She was trying to save the rainforest. He brought her botany. She brought him life.

Same Old - Same Old

It is well-hidden, with a clean water source and good hunting.A week later the decision came: the Court had been persuaded that all gun controls be removed, reasoning that when everyone was armed gun crime would be greatly reduced, due to fear of retaliation.As I write this I can hear possible intruders outside in the dusk. I will defend myself to the

Piles
<|story|>
Hilda winced as she turned into her street. The shopping bags were heavy, the straps cutting into her palms. She spotted Maggie tending to her roses in her front garden and waved.“How are your piles today?” Maggie asked.“Still as huge as ever,” Hilda replied. “It’s getting to the point where I need to get professional help.”Hilda staggered on, until she reached her own home. She entered, placed the bags on the floor and began sorting the contents.“Crime, Historical Fiction, Memoir,” she muttered, whilst adding books to the gigantic ‘to be read’ piles that lined her hallway.

Pamvira, My Love
<|story|>
Mortality corrodes me daily. I’m oxidizing, wrinkling, ageing. Yet if I’m made ever youthful, I could rule the night, even though my heart and soul are frigid.Pamvira’s waiting, keen to gorge herself so we might be together, evermore, from dusk till dawn. She frequents the threshold of my abode till my will crumbles, that I might be reborn.“Welcome, Love! Slake your thirst,” I tell her. “Nocturnal creature, traveller of my dreams, imbed your fangs, the otherworldly portals to a life undead. Imbibe two bloody streams.”No more a sibling of the sun, I’m drained, pale, my transformation done.

It's Not Listening
<|story|>
I popped over to the pharmacy yesterday. Thermometer, cold meds, extra vitamins, Covid test kits, just in case. Masks were sold out and they only had off-brand test kits left. Where once was a plexiglass shield at the register was now open space. Awful, germy openness. The cashier coughed and I lunged backwards. Covid is surging again, they say. Those plexiglass shields won’t be going back up. I’ll be the lone masked shopper, once again. People talk about the pandemic like it’s a distant memory, but Covid is a toddler covering their ears, stomping about, determined to get their way.

The Mountain Man
<|story|>
Inside the park rangers’ office, John collected trail maps, filled up his empty water bottles and applied sunscreen. He had been planning to summit Mt. Hood (4km) for a while. While exiting the office, he heard an approaching noise. A fierce-looking heavyset mountain man appeared, inquiring John’s destination. Hearing his response, the gentle beast shook his head, uttering “Aren’t you following the consequences of climate disasters? Past few years’ drought wiped out all vegetation up there, making me homeless too.”John looked up; the summit appeared bald under a blue sky but scorching sun. He channeled Pogo “Enemies are us.”       (Photo credit: author)

Editor's Choice My mom did not pick me up that day. It had been 3 hours after school. At last, a neighbour came to collect me. Policemen were bustling on the ground below my apartment. I was whisked to my unit on the fifteenth floor. My grandmom was there, sobbing. ‘’Your mom has gone to Bangalore,’’ she told me. My dad stood on the balcony, staring down. The next day, I saw a red spot on the ground where the police stood. It has been two years now. The spot is still there. And my mom has not yet returned from Bangalore.

Many of her conversations began with the phrase: “I just wish that-” It could be prompted by politics, sometimes climate change, frequently global catastrophes.This bothered her. After all, wishing was senseless and actually futile. If repeated desiring the same outcome? Insanity.Once when Rhonda was little, she found herself at the bottom of the stairs. Instead of a short legged, laborious climb, she wished herself to the top. That recollection had never faded.She was secretly convinced everyone must get a single lifetime wish.

It’s boring to keep listing all the missiles flying past my house, and he feels ashamed to talk about his summer trip. We don’t share music or poems unless about conflicts we’re both so tired of.He said he wanted to send me money. I said I wouldn’t be able to pay him back. He went silent for months, another lost friend of mine, another casualty of the war.

Losing My Sentience
<|story|>
I saw a story online titled Watering My Plants. I read it as Watering My Pants, something I had often been doing of late.I saw an advertisement on TV. I couldn't believe the language! "I'm your penis, I'm your fire”! All the women in skimpy bathing suits showing off their smooth legs. It was an advertisement for Venus razors. My nose doesn’t work right. I smell garbage when a fire truck passes, but nothing when something is burning. My taste buds have mutated. Apples are cardboard. Spinach makes my teeth feel funny. I wonder, will my sanity leave soon?

An Eye For an Eye

“Is that wrong?”“Eye for an eye, you mean?” asked the policeman.“I think so”“So, the dog from next door jumped the fence into your garden and dug a hole in your salad patch. In return, you stole said neighbour’s boxers off his washing line and put them in the hole, the dog conveniently dug?”“They were only his boxers. It was a big hole. That dog is a menace.”“In addition; a dress shirt, vest, two pairs of socks, trousers and let's not forget that your neighbour is also the kit man for the local rugby team.”

Colour Corrections

The paint peeling from the walls is blue. Not lagoon blue, or teal, or ship shape navy. It’s pale, watery blue like my Baka’s eyes. Doc says blue is calming, but the separate spaces and locked doors give way to a colourless lie.Twenty years. Two decades in this place. Ten with good behaviour. I’ll be an old man by the time I’m out. I look at the wall through the cracks between my fingers and let my mind detach from my body and dissipate into the wild blue yonder.

Murdered
<|story|>
I went out to feed the dogs and noticed a dead birdie floating in their water bucket. Surely it hadn’t come to get a drink or take a bath and fell flopping, then drowned. It seemed doubtful that Fred, the gentle Shepherd, murdered the bird or that Babe, my loud Lab, had done likewise since there was no blood. As I poured the bucket into the dirt alley out back, I wondered how the bird died and what had been floating through its tiny head as I glanced around, fearing being labeled “bird killer,” before returning to feed the dogs.

Seeing Double
<|story|>
I know that I’m usually slow to notice things, but when did we get a second moon? There are two moons orbiting Earth now, one on each side of the planet, seemingly in synch. When I tuned into the news media, they, along with the government and astronomers, are as stunned by this as I am. It’s brighter at night, sure, but the double pull on the oceans is making tidal waves everywhere, to say nothing of the unpleasant effects on our weather.Maybe God is just showing that He’s still in the universe creating things. . .

The Conscientious Housewife
<|story|>
The light shower brought Sahara dust, but no relief from the heat. It also brought blight. She looked with dismay at the tell-tale blotches randomly scattered among her fine tomatoes, and knew they would all have to be picked. The hottest day of the year found her making chutney, her big cooking pot simmering gently for long hours. No relief came from the open window; the fan just spread hot, humid air throughout the house. She filled the twenty-seven sterilised jars, and put them in the store behind the sixteen full jars left over from last year.

One Star Review

‘I should have checked Tripadvisor’, Sal muttered, watching the spiderweb of cracks radiate towards the edge of the viewing deck. The cracks multiplied, forcing the other tourists to huddle, terrified, at the glass-bottomed boat’s prow. Sal wanted to join them but she was frozen with fear, mesmerized by the school of piranhas circling the boat in the murky Amazonian water. The glass shattered, water boiled through the breach, and the rickety boat sank rapidly. The river churned with blood and torn flesh as the piranhas devoured the passengers. Sal swam for the riverbank, a lone piranha snapping at her heels.

I Miss You

All I can hope is that you didn’t suffer, my love, but I can’t even be sure of that.​All I know is that I miss you.

Rejection

The silence was louder than any words could have been. Kira stared at her father, a man unbendable as steel, waiting for him to speak. “Dad! Aren’t you going to say anything?” When the silence strecthed out between them, anger bubbled up in Kira. Her face flushed and her body shook, a visceral reaction to his lack of response. “Dad!”“What’s there to say, kiddo?” Kira watched as her father scratched his beard. “You know I don’t agree with the art thing.” She could hear the faucet dripping in the other room. Suddenly louder than before.Drip.Drip.Drip. Silence.

Nothing to it, eh?’The first contraction bit hard. The second ripped at his nether regions as if to split him in two.He screamed. Woke.Phew! He glanced at his stirring wife.‘You rest, love. I’ll make the tea.’Jandra smiled.

Tornado

The air is quiet before a tornado hits. When the sirens go off, we are supposed to run to our tornado shelters. My brother is four and has the mumps. He’s lying on the couch in the living room. Our tornado shelter is outside the back door through the kitchen. It is up to me to see if he can make it to the shelter before a tornado hits. I count to ten while he runs from the couch through the kitchen to the backdoor. He always slips on the kitchen floor and I always yell, “You’ll never make it.”

I remember when I met her. She had come home from the hospital a week ago, but she’d been in her bedroom since then. Today, she was in the kitchen.Mum’s back was turned, buttering toast. The angle of the sun through the window hit the frill of the bassinet. An angel’s halo.“Hello, baby,” I whispered, and leaned in close.Wham!I reeled back. She’d kicked me! Mum whipped around. I awaited her comfort for the clear injustice.“Sarah!” she scolded instead. “Leave the baby alone.”I did leave the baby alone after that. For a really long time.

The congregation chanted hymns, recited “Our Father” and “The Lord is my shepherd,” heard the smiling Rector’s homily.That afternoon, Rev. Fred Foster celebrated black client Betty’s passing at his church, a sprawling former warehouse. Paul thrilled to the soprano’s full-throated numbers, shouted “Amen” to Fred’s sermon, and marched around the auditorium singing, hands linked with nearby pilgrims, re-enacting Betty’s moving into her heavenly mansion. Home that night Paul accepted the day: all men and women, sisters and brothers, throngs following two roads, one journey.

It’s love at first sight- as he quickly scoops up his new best friend with soulful eyes and a wagging tail. “He’s mine?” “Yes,” his parents say in unison, thrilled at the first smile they’ve seen since chemotherapy began. Hope quickly blossoming between them.“You hear that, Max? You’re mine. I’m yours.”“A perfect match,” I think to myself, nodding at my coconspirators.I high five the grandparents, smile, and walk away.

When I wake-up, I’m not in my bedroom but your room. It’s a room that opens doors. There’s a view of the pasture with your lovely horses. I take a deep breath, forget about the bruises, the yelling, all the hell. Instead, I think of you, the one I let slip, because I slipped. Now, I see sunrises, sunsets on the farm, the beautiful magic I never noticed in the sky. I think of that bleak day, damn coldest in February, mascara streaming down my face, when you whispered into the phone, “I will save you.”And I finally slept.

I measure the effect depending on the dosages: Critical, has me curled up under the bed. Fear has me foetal under the sheets. Sensitive, I draw the curtains and passive, where I don’t know one day from the next. I have lost my footing. Motes of dust revolving in the first rays of the sun are all it takes to make me afraid.

Swaying, not only to music, but their own personal song. Love and electricity flowing between them. “How do you get there?” I wonder. Passion venturing out from your mind, body, and soul- connecting with another person- simultaneously vulnerable and confident. Trusting that they love you, knowing you’re safe...“Not like this,” I decide, sitting alone, and walk onto the dance floor.

She waited until midnight to dance naked with the full moon, and howl with the wolves. She shook the bones, turned the cards, and studied the crystals and stones. She picked the flowers, weeds, and fungi to be used in her healings. She had no use for Satan, hexes, and curses. Instead, she looked to the heavenly stars, Mother Earth, and her female ancestors for inspiration and guidance. She wanted to live on her own terms, “harming no one and doing as she willed”, but the year was 1692 and, by choosing spirituality over religion, the town had other plans.

The headmistress was pleased- the harvest festival assembly was in full swing and wasn’t usually enjoyed this much. The children that had remembered had all brought in some baked beans for the local food bank. Teachers had brought vegetables to give the display a more traditional feel.Amongst the veg was an unfortunate looking potato. Naturally enough children spotted it and passed on ‘Bum Spud’ quick enough for the whole school to be giggling: it was this that was making the children smile rather than the bountiful harvest of tinned beans.

I’d send gloating images of my tanned self back to England where they’d be shivering through the festive season.“Third degree burns.” The Emergency nurse commiserated as she treated my blistered skin. “You should have known better.”“Just wanted a tan,” I whimpered.

“Can’t see it,” she muttered, eyeing the mountain in the distance.“Imagine it,” suggested her companion.Dew blanketing the valley lifted, revealing sunlit grasses and wildflowers typical of a subalpine summer terrain.“The info guide…” she started, studying the pamphlet she held.“Doesn’t relate to today? Of course not.

Frodo agreed entirely with Ralph. However, he also had a far greater appreciation of the role–and importance–of chicken nuggets.

One year, Shady Jake, a hare who'd spent half of his life running, summoned all the woodland creatures.'We know where the traps are set,' he told them, 'And where the killers hide.'His plan was greeted with unanimous approval. And so it was that, in early Autumn, before the leaves had really started to fall, hares, deer, rabbits and birds played catch-me-if-you-can until the forest resounded with the cries of hunters who had stumbled into their own snares.

The responsibility of carrying on my family's legacy is a burden I no longer wish to carry. For over 70 years, on April Fool’s Day, my family submitted a badly written short story to a top-notched literary magazine.What started as a lark by my great-great-grandfather, a famous novelist who held a grudge against the magazine, soon became a family legacy. This year, my family asked me to fulfill the duty. I submitted my best short story, hoping to break the legacy.The editor sent me a memo: "You short story was hilariously substandard as usual, befitting your family's legacy."

It's not COVID.” I looked down to where I stood on a faded and scuffed “Six Feet Apart for Safety!” sign on the floor, left over from the pandemic.Three days later in that same line, I coughed, sneezed, and smiled at the man behind me. “No worries. I’m sure it's not COVID”.From my hospital bed, I watched the ticker on the TV: COVID SURGE! TAKE PRECAUTIONS.I wondered how that man behind me in line was feeling today.

By the Side of the Road

His corpse is lying by the side of the road. It makes me sad every time I pass him, because I knew him well. Oh, not to speak to, obviously.

Sometimes I think I should remove his body, give it a Christian burial, but those weren’t his beliefs. Besides, nature will take care of it, in its own way.Hail and farewell, Mr Brock.

It began innocently enough. I overheard the teenage barista gush about traveling soon to Japan with her Japanese boyfriend. Having been to the Land of the Rising Sun fifty years ago, during each visit to the coffee shop I mangled phrases for good morning, thank you and delicious, then I got more creative and held up the brew she just poured saying – Die-Joe-Boo-Dieoh– it’s all good.

Janie was pretty sure she was invisible. After nearly a week in 7th grade, no one had talked to her or noticed her in the hallways or classrooms. Teachers didn’t call on her. The gym teacher acted as though she wasn’t even there. A real bummer of a new school year. Maybe it was just moving into middle school from elementary, Janie thought, and she was simply overreacting, thinking it just seemed that no one saw her. That must be it. Suddenly Janie felt better, a little more confident. Then she walked through the wall into her English classroom.

I don’t mind. He sought fame and fortune; I yearned only to create.

Shadows sweep across his face and swallow the room like a disaster meant to be mentioned only in a history book, hidden in the back of the stacks someplace where people who don’t want to know don’t have to look.Later, when the man lights a candle, a bright spot blooms behind the silhouette of the woman. Her shadow leans toward the window and drops to the curb below where her last man is still pacing, smoking a cigar. His hands are full of ashes, his fingers licked with flame.

What’s In a Name, By David Miln
<|story|>
We’re shaped and moulded. Some of us through the school systems. From an early age we carry expectations. Artificially sweetened, boys and girls, or toughened to withstand the slings and arrows. I don’t blame anyone. I know a woman called Freedom – she hates her name. A colleague was christened Odin (imagine!). Changed his name by deed poll to Derek. Not a word from his parents since (imagine!).“Fashioned into versions of our own free will”, sang Kurt Cobain while I was dreaming last night. My birth name is Dantoné. Danton, I could have lived with...You can call me Dan.

I hardly know anything about my family.’Emily woke, immediately recalling the dream.‘That must be my future great-granddaughter’, she realised. ‘The one without a book.’She knew exactly what she needed to do…

Staring at the Past
<|story|>
The vagrant halted in the pouring rain to observe the building in front of his world-weary eyes. A decade or so ago a voice boomed with passion, the passion of religious fervour but the light went out of his belief like a crimson sunset cloud turning grey again.Life was all downhill after that. He carried on preaching for a year or so but felt like an imposter. The church had now morphed into the inevitable flats."What are you staring at mate?" came a hostile voice from the doorway."I'm staring at the past."

Let Me See That Crayon
<|story|>
My little brother’s drawings were stuck on every wall in the house, but one paper was just a blank sheet. When I asked him about it, he simply pointed outside, and there in the middle of the road sat the strangest house I’d ever seen. A round window was in place of the front door, two chimneys protruded from the side walls, and the roof was inverted like a giant V. I turned back to my brother, awestruck. He grinned, and gestured to another newly blank sheet on the wall.“Wait till you see the dinosaurs I drew!”

I’m Voyager 2, and I’m miffed.NASA commanded me to tweak my antennae. I knew it wasn’t right at the time, but what do I know? I’m just a junket of sensors to them. They got all jiggy over those photos of my Uranus though, but now I’m hurtling through space at 34,000mph without a Scooby Doo.

Better get back to taking photos, and lining up the Peruvian panpipe track from my golden record to play to passing aliens. Only 13 more years to retirement!

Representation
<|story|>
They say there are more of us out there. Wild ones where the whole world is their home. It's hard to imagine. Bars, glass and monotony is all I know. My mother raised me here. She never speaks of life before. “We are the chosen ones,” she says. “We remind the furless creatures we exist. If they forgot about us, we would risk extinction.”We are caged so the rest of my kind can know freedom.“Our kin will remember our sacrifice, won’t they mother?” She smiled.“No, son. They are wild and free. Only broken things need reminding.”

The Unexpected Time Traveller
<|story|>
Mum and I sifted through photos. I picked up one of Dad in the 1970's."Before he died, your father told me he'd once built a time machine and travelled to the future and back," Mum said. "He made only one trip and never told another soul because he feared disturbing the space-time continuum."I remembered Dad in his garage, restoring cars, but a time machine?In the photo, Dad held a rectangular object I thought might be a cigarette case. Then I remembered: he'd never smoked. I looked closer. My jaw dropped. The object was unmistakably a mobile phone.

What's in a Name
<|story|>
‘So, she’s a redhead?’ ‘No.’ I said thinking of scarlet poppies and pillar boxes. ‘Ginger then.’ That made me think of biscuits and the powder in my spice cupboard. ‘Nothing like,’ I replied ‘How about auburn.’ I mulled that over for a while. Auburn was a reddish brown, which aptly described my granddaughter’s hair, except her hair was more than that, it was lustrous, the spectacular colour rich with golden highlights that shimmered in the sun. Finally, I had the perfect word: ‘It’s Titian. It has to be because to me she’s beautiful, a real work of art.’

Future Population Reduction Act
<|story|>
“Your vasectomy is done,” the nameless doctor said. “But you aren’t sterile yet. So be aware of the risk of accidental pregnancy. There are severe consequences for a pregnancy. Even though you are 16.”I knew. A pregnancy would mean prison and a mandated abortion.As Mom drove me home, she moaned: “Why did this have to happen? You might have wanted to have a child someday!”Of course, she knew the odds were against me. Since the Future Population Reduction Act passed, the government has required almost all boys (except ones from rich families) to get a vasectomy.

A Happy End

The tribal doctor's expression told me everything. My days were numbered. It would be the end of the misery of my beloved ones who looked after me.The money I had saved lay buried in a box in the compound. I was happy I had made a sketch when my hands and brain worked. My son would soon be well off.When I was on my way up, it rained heavily. The dry fields where my people grew corn would get enough rain. They would be doubly happy now.I waited gladly for the god of death riding a buffalo.

I tumble down, awaiting agonising pain.I hear chirruping and flapping wings create an air cushion. I float down to a soft landing. Enid Blyton has yellowed with age; there are no sweet crumbs. Birds still fly into the tree house but quickly fly out.At the bottom of the tree a plaque reads RIP Helena Carter. 1947 to 1955.

Scent Memory
<|story|>
I’m halfway up the stairs when I smell tobacco and aftershave. Just as quickly, the scents disappear. I second guess they were ever there. My eyes water. Stubby, wrinkled fingers pump air into my bike tires; I lay in a kiddie pool and someone sprays me with a hose, the stream of cold water making me scream and giggle; a gruff voice tells me: some people are only in your life for a season. I go to my bedroom and pull on my suit, grief stitched into its very lining.

Coming Soon to a Shop Near You
<|story|>
I was shopping at the supermarket when I overheard the conversation. A young couple were standing in the frozen goods aisle, looking at the new product.“You haven’t tried Manna yet? You should, it tastes just like meat, like pork, as far as I can remember. It’s better than all those insect burgers! I think it’s grown in a lab, or something.”It’s not really artificial, of course. That’s just a PR job the Ministry concocted. I’m glad that it seems to be working though. It would’ve been a terrible shame had all those climate refugees gone to waste.

Sleepless Lola
<|story|>
The narrow red hotel stood at the lake's edge. Though boarded up for decades now it gave off the impression of fullness and noise. I snapped a photo and strolled back to my campsite to build up our campfire and dole out marshmallows. I'd felt beheld while looking up at the face of the old structure and taking its portrait. The peal of a woman's laughter broke forth from the porch and circled through the campground sometime after midnight. Lola Montez in her black lace and red ruffles.

She shuts her eyes shut and thinks of the pay cheque at the end of the day that will buy medicines for her mother. She opens her eyes to find a man leering at her. Her eyelids flutter and she smiles.

Dot's New Shoes

The shoes would be too narrow for her flat feet, too tight for her chilblained toes, too high to let her run. But they were magnificent. The type of shoes to covet; the type you might conjure up a storm to possess.It didn’t matter to Dot that the woman wearing them needed medical attention, at the very least; didn’t matter that Aunt Em would scold her for their impracticality; didn’t matter that she heard bones crack as she prised them from the feet that stuck out beneath the house. The ruby slippers cried out to be hers.

Solace in Time
<|story|>
Everything was happening too fast. Love. Sex. Marriage. She needed some time to exhale. She needed some time to feel the warmth of nature's embrace. As she strolled in the twilight of summer, she wished Eric understood how she felt. She wished Eric understood that she needed some space to figure out some things and that she only needed him to go easy on her.“Eric, I love you. It’s only that I need some time to see me inside out.”Eric stood looking dishevelled. She stopped by a meadow. The ambience was breath-taking. Tears streamed down her eyes.

“Prime, Prime, Prime….” she yelled from the recliner in the living room balancing her laptop on her knees.“I’m coming..” a breathless voice answered, her walker sliding in first as she entered the room. Excitement tilted her face upward, “I can’t wait,” she said as she shuffled herself to the opposite chair and adjusted her walker to the side. “I know Mama. I’ve had my eyes on that Henkel Knife set for a year.” Then the son walked in. Hair a mess. Dressed in black. “I’m done with prime day,” and raised his new shiny AK47. Prime Day was over.

No Defending Conflict
<|story|>
Laughter and tears bring childhood dreams to life. Blue-eyed boys in dirt and mud, with sticks and stones; guns and grenades.“Help, please help.” Anguished cries reverberate through me nightly. Overcast, darkened skies conceal bombs, and bullets. Horror in the trenches, but this dirt and mud lies on a deadly foreign field.I remember holding him. He looked up, his eyes speaking, “thank you, brother,” as his breath ebbed away. The futility of war is grasped in hindsight. Friendships last forever. But, the fool’s errand is brought into sharp focus every eventide.

I didn’t know you. They said you gave me away as an infant like a mix from a litter.As a child, I scribbled pictures of you. Later, I filled pages in a black diary. Countless times, I studied faces on streets, looking for this selfless woman who brought me into the world. They said you were a baby yourself, terrified, but still, I searched-searched for you. I searched the web, dangling, waiting for that day, the day you walked to me, under a misty sky, the same gait, familiar smile, rain falling with tears.And my whole world shifted.

Traces
<|story|>
Sunbursts, fish, flowers, birds, big-horned sheep and geometric designs, thousands of petroglyphs scattered across a basaltic ridge in New Mexico—the only reminders of the Jornada Mogollon culture of 600 years ago. The summer sun here has no mercy at midday. It illuminates the shadowy corners, where humans once crouched, at dawn or in the cool of the evening, with stone chisels, chipping patina off to expose the rock underneath. “Can’t you see the sign beside the trail?” the park ranger shouts at the wandering tourists who fling Pepsi cans on the parched, ancient ground. “It says ‘Leave No Trace!’”

A 12" Panasonic TV sat on the kitchen counter. Mom slid one of the dining chairs up to the counter, filled my plastic Josie and the Pussycats mug with orange soda and placed it beside a bowl full of potato chips next to the television, then sat my little five-year-old body in the seat. "Don't spill it," she said of the soda and tuned in to channel 10, pushing the rabbit ears around until she found the clearest picture. "I won't," I promised, smile broad, eyes wide at the sight of Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer in living black and white.

Extinguished by its own unsteady newness.My daughter, astute beyond her years, cried as she told me the chick had not had enough time with its mummy, clung to me. We watched all day as parents bristled in flight, darting in and out of the empty nest. At bedtime, I tucked my own fledgling in a little tighter. Checked on her twice before daybreak.

When the melody ended, he stared at wrinkled hands he didn’t recognise, at a piano he didn’t know. A young girl in nurse’s uniform was smiling, gently clapping.

Lightning illuminates the refreshed garden.I move out from the verandah, lifting my face to the now softly falling rain. I feel renewed.

Traps me with a laser gaze. “Sonny, d’yu know the way to this Sagrada Familia?”I pause. My cheeks flush. I shrug my shoulders, mimicking incomprehension.Lie.“No hablo inglese.”

Every day, new lines pleat the formerly pinchable pouches beside my mouth. Dark bags where I store my tears (those ghosts of sorrow) sag. A traffic jam of laugh lines confuses the exits. And who ordered this extra chin? The spare tries to hide under the original like a badly-kept secret.

End of, surely.”Peeved, Sheeved, aching for the last word, coughed, whispered…“Pergola.”

‘The dung beetle is the strongest animal.’ Grandad leant forward in his armchair. ‘It can pull 1141 times its weight. Did you know that, Joseph?’Joseph didn’t know. He was kneeling on the carpet, building a Lego tower. Mum had told him there was no way it could reach the ceiling without toppling; Grandad said, ‘Just watch him!’, but she never did.‘Human equivalent of six filled double-decker buses,’ Grandad continued. ‘Incredible, isn’t it?’Joseph nodded, adding more bricks. In a world where beetles can pull buses, Lego towers can break through ceilings.

The branches were nearby, broken into lengths to fit between the stones, ready for when the flame grew just a few inches. So easy, until that final step. The simplest, but strangely insuperable step.

Coffee steam dances in sunlight. I stare at it often. The curling vapors are an invitation to silently vanish into the light. Here one moment. Gone the next. Not dead… not like that.

That was a little hard to do, being blind.I asked the police to let me interrogate them individually, and they consented. I discovered which one was Frank.You see, four of them would not give me a direct response to any of my questions. However, the fifth suspect always gave me a direct answer, almost to the point of being rude. Yes, he was definitely Frank.

Macular Deception
<|story|>
The early morning beach is quiet. The sun is barely awake. Gulf ripples lightly kiss the shore. The old man plods, and the sand sighs with each step. He totes a sack full of sins, but there is no one to speak with and listen to his apologies. To lighten his load, to nod and offer opinions. To be a friend. He thinks someone is standing near the lifeguard station and shuffles faster, closer, and closer until he stops and wipes his eyes. The weathered sign says, “CAUTION: Rip currents today.”He says, “Thank you,” and moves on.

A Hole in My Garden
<|story|>
There’s a hole where I bury my deepest secrets. First blood and baby teeth, a letter from my long-gone father, a button I cut from the coat of the woman I kinda loved... When Russians came and people fled the village, I stayed behind in fear someone would set my demons free. Quietly, I plant my shattered life, fragment by fragment, in the black soil of my garden. Just the other day, I buried a neighbour girl savaged by the soldiers. One day, they’ll come for me with their guns and Viagra, and then the hole will get it all.

Erosions
<|story|>
I watch dad inspect the adder stone, approvingly placing it in my hand. It's smooth and solid, with a hole no bigger than a bead. Only good things can come through this, he tells me, holding it up and spying into the eroded centre. Winking through it at me.A parting memory before disappearing forever from the beach. Mum restrains my distress in sandy embraces and I raise the stone, desperately squinting for him through glassy, salted eyes. He's gone. The words crash into me as I hurl the wretched thing out to sea. It quickly sinks. Fruitless and hollowed.

All About Neville
<|story|>
Shortly before she died, Mrs Neville Smith gave me a black velvet pouch. 'Please dispose of this for me,' she said. 'Throw it in the incinerator.'She passed away peacefully during the night. Only when she had been taken away did I open it. 'How cruel!' I cried, shocked to see the poppet with a carpenter's nail stuck through its heart. I removed it gently, and the doll seemed to relax in my hands. The telephone rang. It was the hospital. 'Are you Mr and Mrs Neville Smith's carer?''Yes.''Please tell his wife that Neville's out of danger now.'

Tornado Alley
<|story|>
One night there was a massive wind and the swaying trees looked far too powerful and the sodden rain smelt of spice and I looked out the window and saw people running, yet those with umbrellas taking their time. I dreamt that I could cut people in half with scissors, see into their souls and then walk with them to church or the grocery. In the morning we salvaged what we could, threw away splintered swerving branches and like the blind leading the blind, we worked until lunch, said grace and ate. The day had only just begun.

Lending an Ear
<|story|>
“Can you hear me?” shouted van Gogh at the severed ear in his hand. Droplets of blood pooled in his palm, like blobs of paint on a palette. “I’ve listened to you for thirty-five years and now you’ve nothing to say when I ask your opinion.” He laughed madly. “Looks like one of us has lost his head.”He wrapped the ear in paper, went to the brothel he frequented and gave the packet to Gaby, the charwoman. “Treasure this. It will be a valuable relic some day and make you rich after my paintings become famous because of it.”

We have vanilla sex with our husbands on their birthday. We compare how often and what position while our husbands watch the football game. We wear black lace lingerie because we love the feel of silk on our skin. We think food is the sex of the old is a bullshit saying. We practice what we preach.

She Sensed a Presence

Colette grabbed her bag, heading to her apartment.Cigarette smell in the lift. Locking her door, she greeted her cat but Minou wasn't co-operating.She sensed a presence in the flat and her mood changed. Cigarettes again. A sound from her bedroom. A phone? A man smiling menacingly, on her duvet.A scream was trapped in her throat, her efforts to release it pathetic. She ran to her door, realising in despair that it was locked. Screaming now. A rough hand on her mouth, a cloth with strong chemicals. Colette lost consciousness. No hope of escape from this nightmare!

She was half dressed, ropes on her wrists, and no shoes.She wished she had shoes.She struggled to stay upright. The female officer behind the counter lifted her head and looked past the person that she was dealing with. She screamed, there was a scramble from the next room as other officers ran to help.Megan's last thoughts, as she crumbled to the floor, were, “thank God, I made it”.

The sound of laughter he used to raise himself, ringing, or stinging, in his ears, he joins the steady throng of expectant punters, over cobblestones, from one show to the next big thing everyone will be talking about south of the border (perhaps forgotten by the following spring).He weighs the same as a moderately sized chandelier these days, he reckons, With or without shades, no one recognises him. Were he to set himself alight in the middle of the market square, would anyone rush to put him out? A joke in there, somewhere. If only he could find it.

The Return
<|story|>
Her wet kisses devoured me before I could even greet.“The supper will be ready soon.”She took my hands and gently placed me by the fireside before hurrying off to the kitchen. The noisy wood crackled its fumes even as the kids converted the dining table into their imaginary battlefield behind me. Their jabber turns into screams even as the dark smoke engulfs the house. It leaves me with the charred remains of a place I once called home. The last memories of a time lost.No triumph in surviving the horrors. Only a haunting void.

Bed of Roses

He plated the lobster thermidor, poured the Chardonnay, and called to his wife. As she raised her glass, he stared at the garden soil ground into the skin around her nails. She shrugged. “Sorry, I did scrub.” During dinner she addressed how to handle blight and listed the new wildflower seeds she had planted. “You should come and see the roses!” she said. He explained how to select a lobster. He kept glancing at her nails, waiting for her to tell him how he had outdone himself with this meal. Late that night he crept outside and beheaded her roses.

Cemetery Bees
<|story|>
Curling through hexagons of chain-link fence, tendrils of flowering vine curtain tipping gravestones, whose old-fashioned names are filled in with grey-yellow spatterings of lichen: Ruby, Pearl, Aubrey, Beulah. How still the stone and stories therein. All around, the vine is alive with busy life. Scarlet trumpet flowers lure hummingbirds, who chase off competitors of their own species but impatiently permit honeybees to share. One bee, legs laden with golden pollen, backs out of a blossom as a beak edges its way inward. She zig-zags away home. The stories she will tell her hivemates, and how sweet that honey will be.

You were mine for three short years. Well, I thought you were. But I was wrong. When I turned sixteen you left condemning me to a lifetime without you. I still think about you, dream about you.

“I miss the gnomes,” said the cherub.“You had gnomes?” exclaimed the goddess. “But it was a National Trust property!”“They were a secret. She hid them in the rhododendrons.”The goddess snorted. “I had Zeus leering at me for decades. At least I never have to see him again.”There was a commotion nearby.“Don’t look now,” the cherub whispered, “but I think he’s right be…”Two humans approached, carrying something heavy.“Over here?”“Yes, these two go as one lot.”They propped Zeus against the goddess’s shoulder, staring at the cherub.

As It flows

Teeming neon flooded her body. She resounded with every tune. Thousands of people have been dancing with the beat, singing chores, screaming, experiencing almost religious ecstatic happiness. Her chest was overfilled with joy and crystal deep satisfaction that spilled over the edge of her soul. She felt so high, so alive. Her phone blinked. Odesa. Protected historical center destroyed by missiles. She opened the United24 website and donated an amount of morning matcha. Her sight slipped down from the phone. Pink feather stuck in the laces of her Converse. The guilt from being happy raised. Again.

Checking Out
<|story|>
When I’d knocked on Carson’s door this morning, it had been swung open by a hotel employee with a clipboard and a camera. It had only taken a glance at the room to understand why. It looked like it’d been ransacked by raccoons with a taste for vodka, sausage pizza, and drywall. The drapes had been shredded, and there was broken glass on the bed. I had backed out quickly before they could ask any questions. During the free breakfast buffet in the lobby, I eliminated the name from my list. I hope I’d had a good time.

King Herod

Taking an acting class, between his two marriages, over a half century ago, he was trying to portray King Herod, in Oscar Wilde’s play, Salomé. Still lithe and limber back then, he was told, repeatedly by the director, that he should walk much more stiffly, slowly, like an old fellow.Today, when he awakens each morning, grateful to still be alive, he descends very carefully, slowly, and creakily, from his bed to the floor below. He looks back on the bed, but, alas, no unveiled Salomé rests on the other side. Nor does a crown rest on his bald head.

I smiled and said when I learned using the register in 1960 I had to count change without the register’s help. That drugstore was across the street from a pool. Another new cashier was ringing up a sale of a teenage bikini clad girl buying a 99 cent can of hairspray. He rang the 99 dollar key.

It’s nothing like the pictures y’know: train hopping isn’t glamorous. It takes commitment. You won’t make it the first time. Or the second. You’ll doubt, slam your chin, bust your lip, feel rail tie like braces. You’re dirty, and bloody, and your hands are ripped raw and wood filled, but you can’t go home. Wait for the next train; stand like a matador. Some descendant that still has the need to stare at death in every cell. Your lack of ticket a waving red cape, your bull approaches. Be patient. Trains are a lot longer than the movies too. Jump.

Waxing and Waning

Another settlement has failed. Again. What started so auspiciously has ended in chaos and disillusionment. Tears that I didn’t even know I was crying fall onto the paper in front of me, forming puddles on the rough wax portrait I’ve been doodling. It’s her face I always long to replicate whenever the shadows close in. I grip the crayon tighter, as if transferring all of my sorrow into the narrow magenta Crayola. The oxygen will run out, and my lungs will burn in protestation. And still, even though death is on it’s final approach, I can’t help but draw her.

It only takes one word: “Grandma!” Seeing her beloved grandchild brings pure bliss. A smile, a hug, and a kiss later, she’s on the floor playing games- toys strewn everywhere. Laughter, giggles, even an occasional squeal- not sure who’s the loudest.Pizza under a homemade fort. Rules don’t apply here. These co-conspirators hold out for milk and cookies. Plots of extending bedtime already underway. No doubt they’ll be successful. Rumor has it, they’ve never lost a battle.

Desiderium

When they were newlyweds, Dad would entertain Mom by swallowing live goldfish. He amused her as well as her mother, who challenged him to arm wrestling matches and declared herself the winner. Dad would entertain us kids by dropping down stiff and straight in front of us, breaking the fall with his palms as he hit the floor. It thrilled me with a complicated fear I still don’t understand any better than the kind I’m feeling now, watching Mom slyly smile at the man who’s pulling open a can of sardines and letting each one go right into his mouth.

Miss Spencer sighed. The pupils at the inner-city school on her previous placement had known the answer immediately. Rupert’s hand shot up. “It’s a Bermuda sloop,” he exclaimed.“No, silly,” stated Theo. “It’s clearly a beach catamaran.”“Not so!” another boy shouted before insults were hurled. Miss Spencer minimised the photo of the boat and considered moving on to ‘c’ for car.“Quiet reading time!” she declared instead.

Eulogy to the Misunderstood
<|story|>
Editor's Choice This reads like fiction until you understand that it's actually a wonderful tribute to a truly wonderful singer who overcame so much to give so much. Technically, it's therefore ineligible, but I haven't run FFF for ten years without being allowed to bend my own rules in exceptional situations.If you've never heard Sinéad's famous cover of this Prince song, do not ignore – Editor.      What could anyone say? She was a force of nature, like a hurricane or wildfire, burning with the flame of injustice.The Catholic treatment of children and single mothers and cover-up of sexual abuse. Women's reproductive rights, the fight for a united Ireland, the British treatment of peasant farming victims, and the famine never compensated. All I remember was a near-constant sense of intellectual fatigue. I just wanted to hear her sing.Thirty years later, I feel ashamed that she exposed what everyone ignored as the views of a heretic are better understood now it’s too late. Also – there's a poem from Guy Fletcher which you should read here. But he was Editor's Choice last week!:)

He heard a distant jeep closing in, never good news, so the rhino headed into bushes close by.The poachers stopped not sensing his presence. They sauntered past his bush nonchalantly so as to answer natures call. The rhinoceros, seeing them unarmed, moved between man and vehicle turning the tables on those nasty poachers. The rhino scuffed his mighty paws scaring the earth, head down, horns pointed straight at them. He was fast, very fast. The hunters became hunted.

The Branch Manager's tone forbade argument.'I'd better tell Marge.' John dialled his wife's number as he spoke. No answer. She must be doing something important, too, he thought. I'll try again later. Lying at the bottom of the stairs, one leg broken and twisted beneath her, Marge listened to her phone ringing in the bedroom. 'Don't panic,' she murmured. 'John'll be home soon. I'm sure the wait won't kill me.'

Encounter

The doctor spoke carefully.“I love this country. But we are different, older, so much older, our religion, our culture.”The frail woman nodded.“My father knew exactly the day he would die, told us all, his children, many years before. No offense, but spiritually, you Americans are far, far younger.”Her breathing strained.His smooth, dark skin glowed. His eyes, even darker, stared into hers.She felt a catch in her throat, her pulse quickened. The word splendor crossed her mind.A sleek antelope floated by.She leaned in, close, touched his lip lightly.“None taken,” she whispered.

Lucid Dreams
<|story|>
Is it real or just another lucid dream my mind creates to distract me from the pain? I see shadows giving me commands to crawl west. I drink from puddles on the road, thinking that my broken arm will kill me faster than some diarrhea. Then soldiers come, pointing guns at me and asking questions. Never thought that I would cry, seeing yellow stripes on their khaki. In a car, under a drip, I call my wife to tell her that I lost my arm. In her trembling voice, there is something real, of course, but more from lucid dreams.

Generations Benched

My daughter rides the huge Apocalypse roller coaster, while I ride a wooden bench. The solid connection to Earth and a seat polished smooth by the backsides of other waiting mothers who preceded me is a comfort.A metallic screech of roller coaster cars against rails alerts me to the end of the ride.

She shakes her head.Genetics wins out. She will also be a bench-riding mother.

Perfect Barbie
<|story|>
In 2043, they finally made the perfect Barbie. This Barbie had realistic proportions and changeable coloring to match the adoptive "parent's" taste, could move and respond to voice commands, and the AI mind was even capable of soothing conversation.

And there they will remain for thousands of years, even as modern Barbie breaks down into nourishing soil.

Shingles are breaking, falling to earth but the hearth still smells of warm breakfast, eggs sizzling in beds, crisp toast with jam, griddlecakes tanning themselves, milk washed down with coffee torturing, blistered tongues and morning visions. Walls still provide shelter, bedrooms comfort; the swing hanging out back creaks, but shouts of young voices provide strength.

Instinctively I gave her my left hand which she grasped quite strongly.My other hand went towards the lamp, even as she started to lick me.Why? Was this all a joke?It all became clear when the room lit. My wife was lying in a pool of blood.My taste had whetted its appetite.

Date Night
<|story|>
I shouldn’t have gone. Max wanted to take me to see a new film. I don’t like Nordic Noir, but I had hoped he was going to use it as an opportunity to apologise. No chance: the film was awful, the tickets cost a fortune and there wasn’t any popcorn or cola. It was such a long film that by the time the last victim had met her horrible death all the restaurants were closed. So we bought a takeaway coffee and a packet of biscuits and got crumbs over the car seats while we argued.

I passed by him daily, thinking he looked dignified sitting on his blanket, reading, despite his wild, graying dreadlocks and milky red pickled eyes.One day I offered him cash.“I don’t want money.”The next afternoon, I offered a sandwich.“No thanks.”Perplexed, I asked, “What are you reading?”“Bukowski.”“Which one?”“Post Office. Have you read Bukowski?” he asked.“Yep, Factotum…so, you don’t need anything?”“Tomorrow night bring us bottle, a blanket, and a copy of Post Office.”

My Spaghetti and Me

I slept on the couch in front of the mini cinema-sized screen.They were all gone. I had no one left with whom to share my fortune.. A whimper emanated from the basement, followed by scratching on the door. “You all should have learned to be nicer to me,” I shouted.I gave the spaghetti a smug look and dug in.

“We’ve still got room for a short article”, announced the editor, “or a long one if Alyson continues dallying away.”Opportunity, the paper’s food critic slapped together a lengthy scathing review of Gino’s Ristorante, especially harsh on the lasagna: lumpy noodles, flavorless sauce. Then he wrote a short piece that Gino’s is a great place to eat.Alyson also finished her poem in the nick of time and, as a result, many townsfolk decided to go for Italian on Saturday. Afterwards they couldn’t stop raving about Gino’s although the editor, who ordered the lasagna, was heard using unsavory language.

Wake Up Edward
<|story|>
THUD! What was that? THUD! THUD! THUD!I open my eyes but can see nothing. I hear sing-song chanting, maybe sniffling? Weeping? Sounds are becoming muffled. I smell varnish. The starched shirt collar I am wearing is irritating my neck. My feet are cold; the chill is creeping up my legs, torso, chest. I close my eyes against the thick black dark that now soothes and comforts me. I sleep deeper than I’ve ever slept, without dreams. No pain.BRRIINNGGG!“Edward, the alarm went off. You were dead asleep!”Rolling over, he sighed. If only, he thought.

I leapt at the chance for this operation. The Doctor said something, I stood up uncertainly then carefully took my first step.

Trisha did everything right. Burner phone paid in cash. Hair dyed a mousy brown, a nondescript ball cap. Train ticket in hand, she waited in the heat. She opted for a paper ticket to avoid a digital trail. Head low, she boarded, chose a seat far from other passengers and buried her head in a book. “What’cha readin’?” a voice startled her. She cursed her narcolepsy and turned toward the voice.“Misery. King.” Trisha replied, sleepy and annoyed. “I see you’re from Chattanooga,” the man pried. “Trisha Stevens, you’re under arrest.”“Wha-?”“Your library book blew your cover. Cuff her.”

Someone's Not Happy
<|story|>
She stamps her feet, screaming at the top of her lungs. I watch her in the full-length mirror on the far wall. As tantrums go, if they were an Olympic sport, this would be eleven out of ten. Perhaps I’m biased.She pauses a moment, takes a deep breath, then lays on the floor and begins again. Louder and louder, feet and arms flailing wildly, her face the epitome of rage. Finally, the storm abates. She stands and straightens her dishevelled clothes.I salute my reflection in the mirror.Sometimes only a proper two-year-old tantrum can ease the frustration!

Driving Back In Time
<|story|>
There is an ancient church standing in the centre of a now incomplete and even older circle of yew trees. About 800 years ago when the trees were young, they formed a Druidic sacred grove. A friend and I drove there yesterday. As we parked up next to a cornfield, the heavens opened briefly and rain water swirled vigorously into a heavy metal grate near the lychgate. Who knows what circumstances and difficulties prevailed for the people living in this secluded place in a fold in the Malvern Hills. We trod light as a feather across the rain soaked grass.

Their Own Heroes
<|story|>
They have their own heroes. In terrifying times, they fend for themselves, reverting to instincts they’d never had to use. They hunt mice or rats, scrounge for food in overturned bins.The heroes, already worn out by war, refuse to forget them. When the sirens stop, they arrive in dented cars and scratched vans to search. When they find them, they cajole with gentle voices. If permitted, they grab them. If not, they set traps. Finding themselves enveloped in heroes’ arms, they feel relief for the first time in weeks, maybe months.During wartime, abandoned pets have their own heroes.

Kingfisher

Afterwards, they couldn't remember why they'd been arguing. No doubt it had been something trivial, like her scolding him for leaving dirty laundry lying around. Or him accusing her of leaving the cap off the toothpaste.They'd been in the kitchen, their garden visible through a large window. He'd been washing; she'd been drying."Look at that," he'd said, pointing with a foamy hand, cutting her off mid-sentence.She'd leaned closer.Perched on a branch, almost within reach, was a kingfisher, parading its colourful plumage.They'd stared, speechless, their bitterness dissipating as quickly as the soap bubbles in the sink.

Coping Mechanism
<|story|>
Some tried to get ahead – assuming there was a prize. Others claimed their corner, hissed at anyone who came near. A few hoarded gourmet cheeses until they rotted. Some slept through it all. Tired of staring at the wall – too tired to climb out. Some had a bell that sent help running. Others had a lever: they pulled it and numbing liquid flowed until their limbs were jelly. For Gelanda, it was a button. Two holes on one side. An anchor on the other.Shiny. So shiny. It had fallen from the sky to tell her she was not alone.

When the little girl scooped the kitten up out of the box he was born in, he scratched her. So she dropped him into the oblong apartment where he stalked the waxed hallway for a bed. He rejected the closet, wash basin, pillows, everything but her bed. But it faced the door─ bad luck. Thrashing his tail on the floor, the cat watched the girl fashion an alternative of green strips taped at right angles on the rug.

Then, I left.”Strum.“I wrote a song for her.”In the silence, I heard the crickets and the lonely bark of the neighbor’s dog that I named Happenstance. I wanted to laugh, cry, scream, run. Instead, I smiled. “Sing it to me, my friend. It’s nobody’s fault.”

He wore the pointiest shoes that I had ever seen; I couldn’t work out where his toes would go, and soon suspected he didn’t have any. I stared whilst scuffing the toes of my own brown buckled school shoes. I hated them. Mum wouldn’t let me have slip-ons. She’d said that I wouldn’t be able to run in them, remembering made me scuff even harder. I realised he wasn’t a normal adult when he didn’t stop me. I didn’t linger on that thought though.

Eventually, he came right out with it. ‘You’re my queen.’ Then it was, ‘You’re THE queen,’ like it wasn’t only his opinion anymore, like everyone thought it.Funny thing was, no one contradicted him. I had to believe it was true.

I was planning to wear the dress to the courthouse today. The one that checks off his entire list of dislikes. He never handed me the list; I deduced it from his slight frown whenever I wore something floral, colorful, low-cut, or tight-waisted. Months ago, that dress set a thought in motion. I bought it immediately but hid it in the back of the closet. Today, I put it on. Spotting myself in the elevator mirror, I found myself frowning slightly. I went back to change. After nineteen years together, it seems I see myself through his eyes.

Sometimes home is a building made of bricks and concrete. But other times, it is a feeling. A feeling so forlorn that it makes a home in you and locks all doors from outside.Like an empty carcass in the woods, you have waited so long to feel something. Like the hinges of an old mahogany door, your limbs grow weaker from the longing in your heart. Piece by piece, you lose each fragment of your being until there is none left.

Sweaty Tears and Wet Street Dirt
<|story|>
It’d been nearly a week since I’d clumsily dropped a garden stone on my big toe. No big deal, nothing broken, just black, blue and very swollen. However, the bigger issue at hand was the 37 week streak of consistent running I was on. Determined not to break my streak, I laced up on day six. In the humidity of a July morning, I set off running alongside the parked cars. The big toe prefers asphalt over uneven city sidewalks. The human attached prefers straight routes without many turns. The twice monthly street sweeper machine goes where it wants. Ouch!

Pausing my tread to doodle or scrawl I began capturing imagination.You never know, maybe standing their creating I too would spark inspiration for others to also have a go.
