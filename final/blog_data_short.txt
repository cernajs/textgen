A Violent Collision With The Self
<|story|>
Whilst leafing a second-hand book in Oxfam a newspaper cutting fell with a photograph of his childhood abuser. A grotesque mask of a man forty years on with an article about historical serial crimes. Victims had bravely spoken out and others followed. Years of stoically looking the other way when friendship was offered. Rictus smiles to conceal searing pain and acute shame. A laugh was merely an echo of hollow insides, yearning for sincere emotions; self-protection borne of comanding the chaos and pacifying the inevitable storm successfully with convincing fortitude. The next noise he heard was his own primal scream.

Cursed Year
<|story|>
Late summer leaves, brownish green sway earthward.Their dance entrances me from the kitchen window. A shrink may call it dissociating. I call it a respite. In the distance, my phone is ringing and for just a millisecond, I wonder why she is calling me now. My heart sinks. Let it ring. The person whose call I often ignored and sometimes dreaded isn’t calling. The ringing silenced, I decided to listen to her voicemails instead, taking comfort in 2023, as 2024 is almost too much to bear. Dissociating really gets a bad rep.

Backyard Comfort

Editor's Choice Thomas reached through the fence, stealthily plucked and tasted the red, ripe raspberries, and heard weeping from beyond the vines. Small and vulnerable, sitting on the tear-stained garden bench, Sabine looked not at all like the most sparkling girl in grade eight. Concerned, Thomas entered her backyard through the gate. “What’s wrong, Sabbie?” She looked up. “Everything.” “The divorce?” She nodded. “I felt the same way.” Thomas sat beside her and tentatively put his arm around his classmate’s shoulder. Sabine leaned into his awkward embrace and their lips met, soft and salty-sweet – his stolen raspberries mingling with her dusky teardrops.

The Institute of Irony

It sits behind bullet-proof glass, dark as a cave’s mouth, the dimensions of a Pop-Tart. This, says the guide, is what enabled the Age of Repression. They spread like a brushfire with the promise that the world would be at the owner’s fingertips. This was true, to some extent, but they also bred loneliness, anxiety, and narcissism; people lost the ability to read more than a phrase at a time; they became emotional in their reactions. Logic became a lost art. It ensured that people were tractable, divided and dumb. It’s here because of what they were called. Are you ready? Smartphones.

Smoke Break

Eyes closed, bare feet in the sand, I inhale the salty breeze--—and then am bumped by my cumbersome neighbor, barreling out onto the stoop into my shoulder. My eyes squint open and see the street, buildings, bumper-to-bumper cars, people. There’s no breeze—only the flap of dirty pigeon wings and street squirrels fighting over stale fries in the gutter. Honks and shouts assault my ears. I take a drag of my cigarette, the paper sizzles towards my lips; I exhale a large cloud of my own pollution. I am definitely not at the beach.

Lesser infants would undoubtedly have made an effort to wriggle back into the amniotic safety of the womb, but not Gerald. He stayed the course and soldiered on, though he refused to latch onto or take nourishment from his mother’s breast. However, less than two short decades later, Gerald Rensselaer took to other breasts most assiduously.

An unfamiliar metallic clawing noise echoed up the stairwell from the flooded basement. The clawing grew louder. Sharper. Closer. Something big was climbing the stairs.

The Rain Dance
<|story|>
They told me to take the blue pills after you died, mother, but no-no. Instead, I collected 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 pills, shoved them inside my dresser, my fingers sliding on silk until I found the rainstick.Quietly, I slipped out my window at 4 am to walk the neighborhood, shirtless in a pair of panties, the color of sorrow. The voices told me to shake-shake-shake that stick, dance, dance until the heavens, o-p-e-n-e-d, up. When a slight breeze ruffled my hair, I stretched out my arms as cool rain drops came down-down-down. It all washed over me, mother, you-you, you’re healing tears.

The Perennial Summer Invasion
<|story|>
The water’s deep, the struggle pitiful to watch. I could continue onwards, forget I saw this desperate fight for survival. What’s the loss of one among thousands? They’re scum in many people’s eyes. But the picture of suffering burns like a hot poker into my conscience. It’s nothing, yet everything. My gloved hands enter the water, scooping expertly under flailing legs; a thin stream trickles through my fingers. It’s not too late. No doubt she and her kin will return to bug me in a month or so but my heart sings as the wasp vanishes over the privet hedge.

He plants them in serried rows, nine inches between. Root down, crown up. Grafts canine with cuspid, tusk with molar, waters them with rust-colored fertilizer until the ground blackens. He whispers words of growth, and the earth cracks. Bone-white shoots claw upward, sprout fingers, unfurl translucent fronds, silvered thorns--At night, we watch them grow. We watch and tongue the hollows of our gums each time he stoops and turns the soil with shoveled hands. We await the new moon when he plucks the fruit from their stems, when he thrusts them in his mouth.

Reflections

The image in the mirror was unsettling. It was the same old question. Was she look more like her father or her mother? The overgrown eyebrows, dried up skin, bloodshot eyes, and the unceasing frown. That was her father. There was the sagging arm, nervous blinking, and harrow-like corrugations in her forehead. That was her mother. Where was her own influence? Was she just the random mixing of her parents’ genes?“Grandma, can you read Peter Pan to us? And do all the voices! That’s the fun part!”Maybe she was something more after all.

As the color drained from his face, his wife called their daughter Gracie and bellowed, “Help!”When Gracie opened her father’s app her eyes flew open wide. “Yikes, Dad, she yelped, “this is bad. I’m deleting your account right now.”With the posts removed, Dan sunk into bed relieved, clueless he’d soon be unemployed.

A Life Sentence
<|story|>
From atop the precarious ladder the loft was eerie silent, as was the rest of our house without your murderous rage.The decorations, untouched since before they took you away for 12 years. I’d forgotten the personalised glass baubles. Christmas gnomes in green glitter and a red paper scroll inside for 'a secret Christmas wish’.Shuddering, I lost my balance but reached to steady myself. Still, the two baubles fell, smashing on the landing laminate floor below. Two red notes stretched out, unfurled amid a mosaic of glass. Mine read “love you always”. Yours read “Till death do us part”.

Life Lived

“I hate you”, she screams at me, her body tense with rage, fists clenched, face livid. Each syllable penetrates my heart, hurled from an intricately carved spear. Trained well, I feel my feet connecting with socks with shoes, with the old linoleum floor and on through the metal layers of the building to finally touch the earth. Trained well, I sense pulsations travel through skin, muscles, bones. Witnessing a lifetime’s grief. Breathing in a phosphorescence of suffering. Sharing, as always, my mother’s grief.

The worse part about time traveling is the arrival materialization. The electrical sensation of my atoms congealing back together is very unsettling. I hoped they got all the parts this time. They somehow forgot my left ear two trips ago, and the eighteen hundreds didn’t have plastic surgeons. I was still able to create 2,100 pieces of art and 860 oil paintings, but that ear thing haunted me through the centuries. I hid it with long hair and wearing hats, but eventually, I just told everyone I got drunk one night and cut it off.

I tear and twist, breaking you apart and taking everything I can. I peel off your muscle tissues, revealing organs. Liver. Lungs. Kidneys. Noises and suspicious eyes behind—I set it aside.

But that day the river was high, fast. She could not afford slippers. He must have sung Kanhaiya, as he loved. Tears fell. Christine’s face, too, was wet. “Her son, too,” I translated. They wove fingers and leaned, temple against temple. Shyamala said, “ I knew.”

Consider then our astonishment when, the lights having blown, there appeared before us the misty form of William Shakespeare. Over many moons we'd sought him, and now here he was, what there was of him, in the middle of the room. He spoke, but his voice was faint and far away. It might have been 'Who's there?', we couldn't be sure. So, tremulously, we spoke our names aloud. He seemed uninterested. We asked him how he was. No reply, not so much as a shrug. We bid him welcome. At which point he looked at his hands and, half-smiling, vanished.
